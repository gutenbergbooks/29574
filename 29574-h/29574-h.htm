<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Professor Elizabeth Story Donno, in her recent <strong>Elizabethan Minor Epics</strong>
(New York, 1963), has made an important contribution to both
scholarship and teaching. Not only has she brought together for the
first time in one volume most of the extant Elizabethan minor epics,
but in so doing, she has hastened the recognition that the minor epic,
or "epyllion" as it has often been called in modern times,[<a href="#f1">1</a><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1"></a>] is a
distinctive literary genre as deserving of study as the sonnet, the
pastoral, or the verse satire.</p>

<p>The purpose of the present volume is to supplement and complement
Professor Donno's collection by making available in facsimile seven
minor epics of the English Renaissance omitted from it. With the
publication of these poems all the known, surviving minor epics of the
Elizabethan and Jacobean periods will for the first time be made
available for study in faithful reproductions of the earliest extant
editions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII"></a>Pg VIII]</span>Of the seven minor epics included here, three&mdash;<strong>A Pleasant and
Delightfull Poeme of Two Lovers, Philos and Licia, STC</strong> 19886 (1624);
Dunstan Gale's <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe, STC</strong> 11527 (1617); and S[amuel]
P[age's] <strong>The Love of Amos and Laura</strong> (1613)[<a href="#f2">2</a><a name="f2.2" id="f2.2"></a>]&mdash;have not previously
been reprinted in modern times. And of these three, one, <strong>Philos and
Licia,</strong> though listed in the <strong>Short-Title Catalogue,</strong> seems not to have
been noticed by Renaissance scholars, nor even by any of the principal
bibliographers except William C. Hazlitt, who gives this unique copy
bare mention as a book from Robert Burton's collection.[<a href="#f3">3</a><a name="f3.3" id="f3.3"></a>]</p>

<p>The remaining four books&mdash;R[ichard] L[ynche's][<a href="#f4">4</a><a name="f4.4" id="f4.4"></a>] <strong>The Amorous Poeme of
Dom Diego and Ginevra</strong> published with Lynche's <strong>Diella, Certaine
Sonnets, STC</strong> 17091 (1596); William Barksted's <strong>Mirrha The Mother of
Adonis: Or, Lustes Prodegies, STC</strong> 1429 (1607), published with <strong>Three
Eglogs</strong> by Lewes Machin; Barksted's <strong>Hiren: or The Faire Greeke, STC</strong>
1428 (1611); and H. A's <strong>The Scourge of Venus, or, The Wanton Lady.
With the Rare Birth of Adonis, STC</strong> 968 (1613)&mdash;have been edited by the
"indefatigable" Alexander B. Grosart in <strong>Occasional Issues of Very Rare
Books</strong> (Manchester, 1876-77), limited to 50 copies each and hence
extremely scarce today.[<a href="#f5">5</a><a name="f5.5" id="f5.5"></a>] <strong>Dom Diego and Ginevra</strong> was also reprinted by
Edward Arber in <strong>An English Garner,</strong> VII (Birmingham, 1883), 209-240.
With the exception of <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> these poems <span class='pagenum'>[Pg IX]</span>are printed in
their approximate order of composition from 1596 to 1613.[<a href="#f6">6</a><a name="f6.6" id="f6.6"></a>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>AUTHORSHIP</h4>

<p>As befits the paucity of their known literary productions, the authors
of these poems have in common chiefly their anonymity, or a degree of
obscurity approaching it. The authors of <strong>Philos and Licia</strong> and of H.
A's <strong>The Scourge</strong> are unknown. Though the authors of the other poems are
known, little is known about them. The mystery of the authorship of
<strong>The Scourge</strong> was compounded in the nineteenth century by its incorrect
attribution to one Henry Austin. Grosart, for example, argued that the
H. A. on the title page and on the address "To the Reader" of the 1614
impression, and the A. H. on the corresponding pages of the 1620
impression, <strong>STC</strong> 970, was the Austin denounced by Thomas Heywood for
stealing his translations of Ovid's <strong>Ars Amatoria</strong> and <strong>De Remedio
Amoris.</strong> Arthur Melville Clark, in correcting this error, pointed out
that these stolen translations of Ovid should not be confused with <strong>The
Scourge,</strong> an original poetic composition based on Book X of a quite
different work by Ovid, <strong>The Metamorphoses.</strong> Clark concluded that "H. A.
or A. H. was probably the editor, not the author, although he may have
made certain corrections and additions, as the title-page of the
second edition states."[<a href="#f7">7</a><a name="f7.7" id="f7.7"></a>]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg X]</span></p><p>However, H. A.&mdash;not A. H.&mdash;was almost certainly the author of <strong>The
Scourge,</strong> as evidenced, among other details, by the title page of the
1613 <strong>Scourge,</strong>[<a href="#f8">8</a><a name="f8.8" id="f8.8"></a>] unknown to Clark, which unequivocally states:
"Written by <strong>H. A.</strong>" As to the initials H. A. appended to the address
"To the Reader" of the 1614 impression and the A. H. on the title and
address pages of the 1620 impression, they were probably printer's
errors, arising in the 1614 impression from the printer's careless
assumption that the address "To the Reader" was the work of the author
rather than the bookseller, and in the impression of 1620 from a
simple typographical metathesis of the letters H and A.[<a href="#f9">9</a><a name="f9.9" id="f9.9"></a>]</p>

<p>The authorship of the remaining five poems, together with such
relevant facts of the authors' lives as are known, is as follows.
<strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> is by one Dunstan Gale (fl. 1596), about whom
nothing else is known. <strong>Dom Diego and Ginevra</strong> has long been attributed
to Richard Lynche (fl. 1601), otherwise chiefly known for his <strong>Diella,</strong>
a conventional sonnet sequence accompanying <strong>Dom Diego,</strong> and for his
translation of Cartari's <strong>Le Imagini,</strong> Englished as <strong>The Fountaine of
Ancient Fiction</strong> (1599). <strong>Mirrha</strong> and <strong>Hiren</strong> are by William Barksted (fl.
1611), "one of the servants of his Majesties Revels," as the title
page of <strong>Hiren</strong> proclaims. Barksted is believed to have completed <strong>The
Insatiate Countess</strong> after Marston's withdrawal from the stage in 1608
or 1609. This play, bearing Barksted's name in one issue of the 1631
edition, contains a number of lines and phrases identical with lines
and phrases in <strong>Mirrha</strong> and <strong>Hiren</strong>.[<a href="#f10">10</a><a name="f10.10" id="f10.10"></a>]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XI]</span></p><p><strong>Amos and Laura</strong> has been attributed, probably correctly, to Samuel
Page (1574-1630),[<a href="#f11">11</a><a name="f11.11" id="f11.11"></a>] who is mentioned by Meres as "most passionate
among us to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love,"[<a href="#f12">12</a><a name="f12.12" id="f12.12"></a>] and by
his fellow-Oxonian Anthony &agrave; Wood as long-time Vicar of Deptford.[<a href="#f13">13</a><a name="f13.13" id="f13.13"></a>]
Although a few additional facts are known about these authors, none
seems to contribute to an understanding of the poems reprinted, and
all may be found under the appropriate authors' names in the <strong>DNB.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>SOURCES</h4>

<p>Traditionally the storyhouse of minor epic source materials has been
classical mythology, but inevitably, as suitable classical myths were
exhausted, Renaissance poets turned to such sources as the Italian
novella, or even&mdash;romantic heresy&mdash;to comparatively free invention. As
if to compensate for these departures from orthodoxy, the later
epyllionists leaned ever more heavily on allusions to classical
mythology. Of the seven poems included here only three (<strong>Pyramus and
Thisbe, Mirrha,</strong> and <strong>The Scourge</strong>) are based on a classical source
(Ovid's <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XII]</span><strong>Metamorphoses</strong>). Of the remaining four tales, two are drawn
from Bandello apparently by way of Painter, and the last two (<strong>Philos
and Licia, Amos and Laura</strong>), though greatly indebted to <strong>Hero and
Leander</strong> overall, seem not to have drawn their characters or actions
directly from either a classical or more contemporary source. These
last two poems, then, from a Renaissance point of view, are
comparatively free inventions. But both, and especially <strong>Philos and
Licia</strong>, are a tissue of allusions to classical mythology.</p>

<p>Gale in <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> expands Golding's translation of Ovid's
<strong>Metamorphoses,</strong> IV, from some 130 to 480 lines, Barksted expands less
than 300 lines of Golding's <strong>Ovid,</strong> X, to nearly 900, and H. A. enlarges
the same tale to about 950 lines.[<a href="#f14">14</a><a name="f14.14" id="f14.14"></a>] It should be emphasized,
however, that these are not mere amplified translations, but
reworkings of the classics, with significant departures from them.
Gale, for example, prefaces the romance of Pyramus and Thisbe with
their innocent meeting out-of-doors in an arbor, amid violets and
damask roses. He has Venus, enraged at seeing these youngsters
engaging in child-like rather than erotic play, command Cupid to shoot
his arrows at them "As nought but death, their love-dart may remove"
(<a href="#Page_44">Stanza 8</a>). There is no counterpart to this opening scene in Golding's
Ovid.</p>

<p>Similarly Barksted departs at length from Ovid in the beginning of his
tale, where the Renaissance poet undertakes to explain why Mirrha is
cursed with love for her father. While she listens to the sweet, sad
songs of Orpheus, Cupid,[<a href="#f15">15</a><a name="f15.15" id="f15.15"></a>] falling in love with her, courts her and
is rejected; his parting kiss "did inspire/her brest with an infernall
and unnam'd desire" (<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>). Gold<span class='pagenum'>[Pg XIII]</span>ing's Ovid, specifically denying
that Cupid had anything to do with Mirrha's unnatural love, suggests
that Cinyras' daughter must have been blasted by one of the
Furies.[<a href="#f16">16</a><a name="f16.16" id="f16.16"></a>] Other inventions of Barksted include a picture of her
father with which Mirrha converses (<a href="#Page_126">pp. 126-127</a>), pictures of her
suitors (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>), a picture of her mother, over which she throws a
veil (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>) and a description of Mirrha herself (<a href="#Page_131">pp. 131-132</a>). Later
in the story Mirrha meets a satyr named Poplar (unknown to Ovid), who
makes free with her (<a href="#Page_148">pp. 148-155</a>). As punishment for such goings on in
Diana's sacred grove, he is to be metamorphosed into the tree that now
bears his name (even as Mirrha is subsequently transformed into the
tree that produces myrrh).</p>

<p><strong>The Scourge of Venus,</strong> though following Ovid's story more closely than
<strong>Mirrha,</strong> expands Golding by more than 600 lines, to a little more than
the average length of the Elizabethan minor epic. In the process, Mirrha is assigned lustful dreams not found in
Ovid (<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 246"><a href="#Page_236">p. 236</a></ins>), and is
impelled to write a long letter to her father (<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 247-250"><a href="#Page_237">pp. 237-240</a></ins>). Shortly thereafter, the author introduces an emphatically Christian digression
on the horror of Mirrha's "fowle incestious lust" and on the
importance of reading <strong>"Gods holy Bible"</strong> as a salve for sin
(<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 253"><a href="#Page_243">p. 243</a></ins>), and
invents the Nurse's prolix arguments against such "filthy" love as Mirrha desires
(<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 258-261"><a href="#Page_248">pp. 248-251</a></ins>).[<a href="#f17">17</a><a name="f17.17" id="f17.17"></a>] The
fact that the author follows Ovid's story <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XIV]</span>as closely as he does should be taken as a commentary on
his limited powers of invention rather than on his devotion to the art
of translation.</p>

<p>Bandello, I, 27, Belleforest, 18, Whetstone's <strong>Rocke of Regard,</strong> 2,
Fenton's <strong>Tragicall Discourses,</strong> 13, and Painter's <strong>Palace of Pleasure,</strong>
II, 29[<a href="#f18">18</a><a name="f18.18" id="f18.18"></a>] have all been listed as possible sources for <strong>Dom Diego and
Ginevra.</strong>[<a href="#f19">19</a><a name="f19.19" id="f19.19"></a>] Grosart regarded Fenton's work, 1579, as the source from
which Lynche got the bare bones of his story, and Arber agreed.[<a href="#f20">20</a><a name="f20.20" id="f20.20"></a>]
But though Jeannette Fellheimer could find no evidence that Lynche
knew Belleforest's or Fenton's version of the tale, she demonstrated,
on the basis of two very close parallels, that he knew Painter's.[<a href="#f21">21</a><a name="f21.21" id="f21.21"></a>]
In support of Fellheimer's view, one notes that Lynche follows Painter
in employing the form "Cathelo[y]gne"[<a href="#f22">22</a><a name="f22.22" id="f22.22"></a>] (<a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) rather than Fenton's
"Catalonia."[<a href="#f23">23</a><a name="f23.23" id="f23.23"></a>]</p>

<p>Barksted may have known ballads on the subject of Hiren, alluded to in
<a href="#Page_184">stanza 34</a> of his poem, as well as Peele's lost play <strong>The Turkish
Mahomet and Hyren the fair Greek.</strong> But like Lynche, he seems heavily
indebted to a tale by Painter, in this case "Hyerenee the Faire
Greeke."[<a href="#f24">24</a><a name="f24.24" id="f24.24"></a>] Among other equally <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XV]</span>striking but less sustained
correspondences between Painter's prose narrative and Barksted's minor
epic verse, one notes the following, in which Mahomet's confidant
Mustapha attempts to reanimate his leader's martial spirit, drowned in
uxoriousness: "But nowe I cannot revive the memorie of your father
Amurate, but to my great sorow and griefe, who by the space of XL.
yeres made the sea and earth to tremble and quake ... [and so cruelly
treated the Greeks] that the memorie of the woundes do remaine at this
present, even to the mountaines of Thomao and Pindus: he subjugated
... all the barbarous nations, from Morea to the straits of Corinthe.
What neede I here to bring in the cruel battell that he fought with
the Emperour Sigismunde and Philip duke of Burgundia wherein he
overthrew the whole force of the Christians, toke the emperour
prisoner, and the duke of Burgundie also ... or to remember other
fierce armies which he sent into Hungarie."[<a href="#f25">25</a><a name="f25.25" id="f25.25"></a>]</p>

<p>Barksted versifies this speech in <a href="#Page_173">stanzas 1 and 2</a>, putting it at the
beginning instead of toward the end, where it comes in Painter's
novella. By a poetic license, Barksted credits all these achievements
to the son, none to the father. Barksted follows Painter's story quite
closely, but he cuts, amplifies and invents in order to develop its
minor epic potentialities. Thus, in addition to turning Painter's
prose into the sixains of Shakespeare's <strong>Venus and Adonis,</strong> he cuts the
length of Painter's tale by about two-thirds. In the process, much of
Painter's attention to historical detail, his complication of plot,
and his tedious moralizing are mercifully lost. By way of
amplification in the minor epic mode, Barksted expands as follows
Mahomet's brief command in Painter that Hiren should "adorne herselfe
with her most precious jewels, and decke her with the costliest
apparell shee had" (see <a href="#Page_208">stanza 100</a>).[<a href="#f26">26</a><a name="f26.26" id="f26.26"></a>] Also, in order to bring out
Mahomet's <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XVI]</span>realization of the enormity of his crime of slaying Hiren,
the consummation of all his amorous dreams, Barksted invents a second
killing&mdash;Mahomet's killing of Mustapha, who had driven his lord to
perform the first execution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>

<p>Like the poems reprinted by Professor Donno, these establish their
identity as minor epics by the erotic subject matter of their
narration, however symbolized or moralized, and by their use of
certain rhetorical devices that came to be associated with the genre.
These include the set description of people and places; the <strong>suasoria,</strong>
or invitation to love; and the formal digression, sometimes in the
form of an inset tale, such as the tale of Poplar in <strong>Mirrha</strong> (<a href="#Page_148">pp.
148-155</a>). Other rhetorical devices cultivated in the epyllion are the
long apostrophe, and the sentence or wise saying. Also, these poems
employ numerous compound epithets and far-fetched conceits. (Dom Diego
goes hunting with a "beast-dismembring blade" [<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>], and Cinyras
incestuous bed in <strong>The Scourge</strong> "doth shake and quaver as they lie,/As
if it groan'd to beare the weight of sinne." [<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 271"><a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a></ins>].)</p>

<p>The average length of these, like other Renaissance minor epics, is
about 900 lines. Although the length of Renaissance minor epics is not
rigidly prescribed, it is noteworthy that several of these poems have
almost the same number of lines. <strong>Philos and Licia, Mirrha,</strong> and <strong>Hiren,</strong>
for example, running to about 900 lines, vary in length by no more
than 16 lines. (<strong>Amos and Laura,</strong> however, the shortest with about 300
lines, is some 650 lines shorter than <strong>The Scourge,</strong> the longest, with
about 950.)</p>

<p>As well as echoing Marlowe's <strong>Hero and Leander</strong> and Shakespeare's <strong>Venus
and Adonis</strong> in particular words and phrases, these poems reveal a much
more general indebtedness to what Professor Bush has aptly called "the
twin peaks of the Ovidian tradition in England."[<a href="#f27">27</a><a name="f27.27" id="f27.27"></a>] The majority
employ one of two <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XVII]</span>prosodic patterns&mdash;the Marlovian couplet
popularized in <strong>Hero and Leander,</strong> or the six-line stanza used by Lodge
but soon after taken over by Shakespeare in <strong>Venus and Adonis</strong> and
thereafter associated with his poem.[<a href="#f28">28</a><a name="f28.28" id="f28.28"></a>]</p>

<p>In addition to the couplet, a common mark of Marlovian influence in
the poems is the etiological myth, sometimes expanded into a tale.
Thus, in <strong>Mirrha,</strong> for instance, the growth of rare spices and perfumes
in Panchaia is explained by the story of how Hebe once spilled nectar
there (<a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>).</p>

<p>Comparable marks of Shakespearean influence are the aggressive female
like Mirrha, reminiscent of Shakespeare's Venus; the hunting motif in
<strong>Dom Diego</strong> and <strong>Amos and Laura,</strong> recalling Adonis' obsession with the
hunt; and the catalog of the senses in <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> <a href="#Page_15">pp. 15-16</a>,
and <strong>Hiren,</strong> <a href="#Page_199">stanzas 75-79</a>, which imitates Shakespeare's <strong>Venus and
Adonis,</strong> ll. 427-450. Only <strong>Mirrha</strong> among these poems, however, makes
specific acknowledgment of a debt to Shakespeare (see <ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 177"><a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a></ins>). Finally, Dom Diego's plangent laments at Ginevra's cruelty recall
<ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'Glancus'.'">Glaucus'</ins> unrestrained weeping at Scylla's cruelty in Lodge's <strong>Scillaes
Metamorphosis.</strong> But whereas the "piteous Nimphes" surrounding Glaucus
weep till a "pretie brooke" forms,[<a href="#f29">29</a><a name="f29.29" id="f29.29"></a>] "the fayre <strong>Oreades</strong> pitty-moved
gerles" that comfort Dom Diego are loath to lose the "liquid pearles"
he weeps. Consequently they gather (and presumably preserve) them with
"Spunge-like Mosse" <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XVIII]</span>(<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>). Lynche extends his debt to Lodge by
establishing at the end of his poem a link between Ginevra and the
Maiden he professes to love. But, whereas Lodge in the Envoy to his
poem uses Scylla on the rocks as a horrible example of what may happen
to unyielding maids, Lynche holds up Ginevra, who finally marries her
lover, as an example to be followed by the poet's disdainful Diella of
the accompanying sonnets (see <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>).</p>

<p>It would probably be impossible, even if it were desirable, for any
given minor epic to follow all the conventions of the genre, or even
all its alternative conventions. Yet all the poems included here
adhere so closely to most of the important minor epic conventions that
there should be no question as to the minor epic identity of any.[<a href="#f30">30</a><a name="f30.30" id="f30.30"></a>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY EDITIONS</h4>

<p><strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> though entered on October 2, 1606 and presumably
printed soon thereafter, survives only in the unique copy of the 1624
edition printed by W. S. [William Stansby?] for John Smethwick. (No
record of transfer of this poem from William Aspley, who entered it,
exists, though Aspley and Smethwick were associated, along with
William Jaggard, in the publication of Shakespeare's First Folio of
1623.)</p>

<p>Robert Burton bequeathed this copy of <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> along with
many of his other books, to the Bodleian Library in 1639. Under the
terms of his will the Bodleian was to have first choice of his books,
unless it already had duplicates, and Christ Church, Burton's college,
second choice. Along with <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> the Bodleian received the
following other minor epics from Burton's collection: <strong>Pigmalion's
Image</strong> (1598), <strong>Venus and</strong><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XIX]</span> <strong>Adonis</strong> (1602), <strong>Samacis and Hermaphroditus</strong>
(1602), and <strong>Hero and Leander</strong> (1606).[<a href="#f31">31</a><a name="f31.31" id="f31.31"></a>] Burton regularly wrote his
name in full, some abbreviation thereof, or at least his initials, on
the title page of his books, usually across the middle. In <strong>Philos and
Licia,</strong> Burton's heavily and distinctively written initials RB are
written a bit below the middle of the title page, on either side of
the printer's device.[<a href="#f32">32</a><a name="f32.32" id="f32.32"></a>] Also in its typical location at the bottom
of the title page is found "a curious mark, a sort of hieroglyphic or
cypher," which Burton almost always affixed to his books. The
significance of this device remains obscure; it "has usually been
supposed to represent the three 'R's' in his name joined
together."[<a href="#f33">33</a><a name="f33.33" id="f33.33"></a>]</p>

<p>Although the dedication of Dunstan Gale's <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> is dated
November 25, 1596, no copy of an earlier edition than that printed in
1617 for Roger Jackson is extant. The unsophisticated, highly
imitative style of the piece, the date of the dedication, and the fact
that the printer's device in the 1617 edition is an old one, used
previously in 1586-87 by Ralph Newbery,[<a href="#f34">34</a><a name="f34.34" id="f34.34"></a>] to whom Jackson was
apprenticed from 1591-99,[<a href="#f35">35</a><a name="f35.35" id="f35.35"></a>] <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XX]</span>suggests that the poem was originally
published by Newbery about 1596. Probably this first edition had the
same device as the edition of 1617, and a similar title page.
According to Newbery's will, Roger Jackson and John Norcott were to
receive his stock of books on Fleet Street, but McKerrow, citing the
Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 30, Hudlestone as his authority, says
the offer seems not to have been taken up.[<a href="#f36">36</a><a name="f36.36" id="f36.36"></a>] Gale's poem would seem
to constitute an exception to this generalization.</p>

<p><strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> was also issued with Greene's <strong>Arbasto</strong> in 1617. On
Jan. 16, 1625/26 Gale's poem was transferred from Roger Jackson's
widow to Francis Williams,[<a href="#f37">37</a><a name="f37.37" id="f37.37"></a>] who had it printed for the last time in
1626.</p>

<p>Nothing of note has been turned up with regard to the first and only
early edition of Lynche's <strong>Dom Diego</strong> and <strong>Ginevra</strong> (1596).</p>

<p>According to their first modern editor, A. B. Grosart, the first and
only early editions of <strong>Mirrha</strong> and <strong>Hiren</strong> are notorious for their
wretched typography and printing errors of various kinds.[<a href="#f38">38</a><a name="f38.38" id="f38.38"></a>] He
writes, "In all my experience of our elder literature I have not met
with more carelessly printed books. Typographical and punctuation
errors not only obscure the meaning but again and again make places
absolutely unintelligible."[<a href="#f39">39</a><a name="f39.39" id="f39.39"></a>] Their author Barksted must share the
blame, Grosart opines, for some of the poem's errors would seem to
show that he was "ill-educated and unpractised in composition."[<a href="#f40">40</a><a name="f40.40" id="f40.40"></a>]
Henry Plomer agrees with Grosart that Edward Allde, the printer of
<strong>Mirrha,</strong> was guilty of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXI]</span>poor
type and workmanship.[<a href="#f41">41</a><a name="f41.41" id="f41.41"></a>] Perhaps the
grossest example in <strong>Mirrha</strong> of the kind of thing Plomer may have had in
mind is the tipping of the type on the title page of the two copies of
this poem which have come to my attention.[<a href="#f42">42</a><a name="f42.42" id="f42.42"></a>] Another example would
be the awkward separation of the "A" in "Adonis" on one line of the
title page from the rest of the word on the next.</p>

<p>But although <strong>Mirrha</strong> is indeed a printer's nightmare, it strikes me
that Grosart is far too severe in his strictures against <strong>Hiren,</strong> which
was quite attractively and reasonably accurately printed, probably by
Nicholas Okes,[<a href="#f43">43</a><a name="f43.43" id="f43.43"></a>] who also printed <strong>The Scourge.</strong> Indeed Grosart has
"corrected" a number of details of punctuation in the poem which might
better have been left standing, in view of the generally light
punctuation of Barksted's day. In two instances Grosart has even
"corrected" details which, as "corrected," follow the unique copy of
<strong>Hiren,</strong> the Bodleian copy which he consulted.[<a href="#f44">44</a><a name="f44.44" id="f44.44"></a>]</p>

<p>Page's <strong>Amos and Laura</strong> was first published in 1613,[<a href="#f45">45</a><a name="f45.45" id="f45.45"></a>] a second time
in 1619. Finally, in 1628, a second impression of the edition of 1613,
with slight variants from it, was printed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXII]</span>In the nineteenth century <strong>Amos and Laura</strong> was remarked upon chiefly
for its dedicatory verses to Izaak Walton in the unique copy of the
1619 edition at the British Museum, verses found neither in the then
only known, imperfect British Museum copy of the 1613 edition, nor in
the impression of 1628. These verses have long been thought to
constitute the first reference to Walton in print. But three
additional copies of the 1613 edition have by now come to light, at
the Folger, the Huntington, and at the British Museum.[<a href="#f46">46</a><a name="f46.46" id="f46.46"></a>] All three
copies, though variously imperfect, contain the dedicatory verses.[<a href="#f47">47</a><a name="f47.47" id="f47.47"></a>]</p>

<p>A word remains to be said about the way in which the second impression
of the 1614 <strong>Scourge,</strong> "corrected, and enlarged, by H. A." differs from
the first edition of 1613. Though long thought to be identical with
the first edition,[<a href="#f48">48</a><a name="f48.48" id="f48.48"></a>] the second impression, besides being corrected
in a number of details, is "enlarged" by the following two stanzas
after the line on <ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 262"><a href="#Page_252">p. 252,</a></ins> "Helpe Nurse, else long I cannot live."[<a href="#f49">49</a><a name="f49.49" id="f49.49"></a>]</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some say (and you can tell the truth likewise)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When women once have felt that they cal sport,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in their wombe a Tympanie doth rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For things peculiar they do oft import:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And though most odious it do seeme to some,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Yet give it them or they are quite undone.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXIII]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so my case most desperate standes you see,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It is most sweete and wholsome unto mee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Though it seeme bad and odious unto thee.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third impression of 1620 follows the edition of 1613 but prints
three stanzas to a page instead of four.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>LITERARY VALUE</h4>

<p>Much of the literary value of these poems, it should be recognized, is
historical. Like Henry Petowe's romance, <strong>The Second Part of Hero and
Leander</strong> (1598), they are fully as interesting as reflections of the
poetic genius of Marlowe and/or Shakespeare, mirrored in the works of
their less gifted contemporaries, as they are in themselves. Apart
from their historical significance, however, all these poems have
intrinsic interest, and several, including <strong>Dom Diego, Mirrha</strong>
and <strong>Hiren</strong> as well as <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> have a considerable
degree of literary merit as well. Whoever the author of <strong>Philos and
Licia</strong> may have been, he was one who had thoroughly assimilated the
conventions of the minor epic, especially those employed in <strong>Hero and
Leander.</strong>[<a href="#f50">50</a><a name="f50.50" id="f50.50"></a>] Unlike Page, whose imitation of Marlowe is for the most
part blind, this author is skillful in working many of these
conventions, and even particular words and phrases from other minor
epics, into the context of his poem, somewhat as the bards of major
epic are supposed to have done. Surprisingly, in view of this
technique of composition, the poem is well integrated, and
consistently smooth and fluent in its versification.[<a href="#f51">51</a><a name="f51.51" id="f51.51"></a>]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXIV]</span>As much as this unknown poet must have admired Marlowe's verse, he
evidently could not stomach the elder poet's conception of a hostile
universe, or his glorification of unwedded bliss. Accordingly he
constructed in <strong>Philos and Licia</strong> a world in which all goes well
provided one follows the rules, and where one of the key rules is that
Hymen's rites must precede love's consummation. One of Licia's chief
responsibilities, in addition to summing up all feminine perfections,
is to enforce this rule. Philos, though severely tempted to violate
it, soon yields to Licia's virtuous admonitions, for he is, let it be
known, a pliant youth, almost as devoted to Licia's will as the knight
in Chaucer's Wife of Bath's tale to the Loathly Lady's. The poem ends
happily, with the gods attending the lovers' nuptials. The result of
this too easily ordered union of souls and bodies, unhappily for this
otherwise charming poem, is an insufficiency of conflict. Aside from
the poem's un-Marlovian insistence on matrimony, its most notable
feature is its skillful and sustained use of light and dark imagery,
recalling Chapman's much less extensive treatment of such imagery in
his conclusion of Marlowe's poem and in Ovid's <strong>Banquet of Sense.</strong></p>

<p>Gale's <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> begins with a moderately engaging portrayal
of the youngsters' innocent friendship; it soon falls into absurdity,
from which it never subsequently gets entirely clear. Gale seems to
have had no inkling of the ridiculous possibilities of "serious"
verse. Consequently, he is able to write of Pyramus and Thisbe
"sit[ting] on bryers,/Till they enjoyd the height of their desires,"
(<a href="#Page_47">Stanza 13</a>), with no sense of the incongruity of the image employed.
With similar ill effect in its pathetic context, Thisbe's nose bleed
is introduced as an omen of disaster (<a href="#Page_57">Stanza 33</a>), and Pyramus' "angry"
blood, by a ridiculously far-fetched conceit, is said to gush out "to
finde the author of the deed,/But when it none but <strong>Pyramus</strong> had found,/
Key cold with feare it stood upon the ground" (<a href="#Page_55">Stanza 30</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXV]</span><strong>Dom Diego,</strong> though a pleasant, occasionally charming imitation of
Lodge's <strong>Scillaes Metamorphosis,</strong> employs fewer of the epyllionic
conventions than <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> and uses them less imaginatively.
Though it never achieves a style of its own, it is quite successful in
recapturing the lachrymose artificiality that marks Lodge's poem.</p>

<p>Despite its oblique opening and occasionally awkward style, Barksted's
<strong>Mirrha</strong> is a poem of more power than <strong>Dom Diego.</strong> Among its more
affecting passages are a vivid portrayal of a "gloomy gallerie" lined
with portraits of Mirrha's suitors (<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 128"><a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a></ins>) and an inventive account
of Hebe's spilling the nectar that rained spices on Panchaia (<a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>).
Barksted's early and unqualified recognition of Shakespeare's
greatness, and his humbly accurate assessment of his own limited
powers, compared to "neighbor" Shakespeare's, are quite disarming. One
gets the uncomfortable sense, however, that Barksted in both <strong>Mirrha</strong>
and <strong>Hiren,</strong> like H. A. in <strong>The Scourge</strong> after him, is a moral fence
straddler, enjoying vicariously the lasciviousness he so piously
reprehends.</p>

<p><strong>Hiren</strong> as treated by Barksted is also deficient in imagination of a
high order, but is a more absorbing story than <strong>Mirrha.</strong> As signaled by
his undertaking a more intricately rhymed stanza than he attempted in
his first poem, Barksted's versification and composition in the second
poem are superior. The poet achieves his most telling effects in <strong>Hiren</strong>
not from invention but from the elaboration of such source materials
in Painter as permit him to capture the distinctive glittering
artifice of minor epic. His catalog of the senses (<a href="#Page_199">Stanzas 75-79</a>)
serves as an example of this power of embellishment at its best.</p>

<p>Page's <strong>Amos and Laura,</strong> like Gale's <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe,</strong> falls into
bathos near the end when Amos, in an extended comparison, likens
Laura's refusal to cure his love wound to an avaricious doctor's
refusal to set a poor man's leg. Page's failure as a poet is not a
result of temporary lapses, as here, but of his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXVI]</span> inability to invent
significant conflict. As Amos says, with unintentional irony on <ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 235"><a href="#Page_225">page
225</a></ins>:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There are no Seas to separate our joy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No future danger can our Love annoy.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is precisely the problem. But in spite of the poem's obvious
weakness, one is drawn to the man who wrote it for his obviously
sincere, self-deprecatory references to his "weake wit" and "inferiour
stile." Fully aware of his limitations, Page, like Barksted and many
another unexceptional talent of his age, was nevertheless drawn to the
composition of poetry like a moth to the flame.</p>

<p><strong>The Scourge</strong> is a straightforward and lively but undistinguished
redaction, in sing-song verse, of the well-worn Mirrha story. Its
chief but nevertheless dubious merit, over against the epyllionic
tradition, is its no-nonsense approach to the art of minor epic
narration. Although it expands Ovid's speeches and descriptions where
feasible and introduces a degree of invention en route, it is
singularly barren of such adornments as epithets, set descriptions,
and formal digressions. In consequence, it lacks the distinctive hard,
bejewelled brilliance of minor epic that characterizes Barksted's
poetry at its best.</p>

<p>In summation, then, we see that although <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong> and <strong>Amos
and Laura</strong> have slight literary value, <strong>The Scourge,</strong> while failing to
score very high as a minor epic, yet has a certain crude, narrative
vitality. And <strong>Dom Diego, Mirrha, Hiren,</strong> and <strong>Philos and Licia,</strong> by
virtue of their charm, inventiveness, or skillful adaptation of minor
epic conventions to their expressive needs, form a hierarchy of
increasing literary value that raises them as a group well above the
level of the merely imitative.</p>

<p>For permission to reproduce <strong>Philos and Licia</strong> (for the first time),
<strong>Mirrha,</strong> and <strong>Hiren,</strong> I am much indebted to the Bodleian Library; for
permission to reproduce <strong>Dom Diego and Ginevra</strong><span class='pagenum'>[Pg XXVII]</span> I am similarly indebted
to the Trustees of the British Museum. I am also under heavy
obligation to the Folger Library for permission to reprint <strong>Pyramus and
Thisbe, Amos and Laura,</strong> and <strong>The Scourge of Venus</strong> (1613), all for the
first time.</p>

<p>I also wish to express my thanks to The British Museum, the Bodleian
Library, the University of Michigan, and the Ohio State University
libraries for generous permission to use their collections, and to the
Board of College Education of the Lutheran Church in America for a
six-week summer study grant, which enabled me to gather research
materials for this project.</p>

<p>For help and encouragement in a great variety of ways I am grateful to
the following mentors and colleagues: Professor John Arthos, who first
introduced me to the beauty of minor epic, the late Professor Hereward
T. Price, and Professor Warner G. Rice, all from the University of
Michigan; Professor Helen C. White of the University of Wisconsin;
librarians Major Felie Clark, Ret., U. S. Army, of Gainesville,
Florida, and Professor Luella Eutsler of Wittenberg University; and

chief concern in this article was to show that the kind of poetry
described therein, though in years past loosely and variously referred
to by such terms as "Ovidian poetry" or "mythological love poetry,"
and often lumped together indiscriminately with other kinds such as
the complaint, the tragical history, and the verse romance, actually
constitutes a distinct genre recognized in practice by Renaissance
poets. Whether or not there is classical authority for use of the term

issue here. Either the term "minor epic" or "epyllion" is
satisfactory, provided its referent is clear, and accurately

epithets as "azure-veyned necke" and "Nectar-candied-words," Gresham
expands Golding's Ovid by more than 300 lines. Although he invents a
suitable brief description of Mirrha's nurse, whom he calls "old
trott," and throws in a few erotic tid-bits quite in the spirit of the
minor epic, he never departs from Ovid's story line and never
introduces descriptive detail of which there is not at least a hint in
Ovid.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f28.28">28</a><a name="f28" id="f28"></a>] Two (<strong>Philos and Licia, Amos and Laura</strong>) employ the Marlovian
couplet, two (<strong>Dom Diego</strong> and <strong>The Scourge</strong>) the Shakespearean sixain, and
Barksted's two employ eight-line stanzas, with <strong>Mirrha</strong> rhyming
<strong><i>ababccdd</i></strong> (the Shakespearean stanza plus a couplet), and <strong>Hiren</strong>
rhyming <strong><i>ababbcac</i></strong>, a more tightly knit departure from Shakespeare's
stanza. The last, <strong>Pyramus and Thisbe</strong>, suggests its debt to both
masters&mdash;or plays both ends against the middle&mdash;by employing a 12
(2&times;6)-line stanza composed of couplets, with the last couplet having a
double rhyme probably designed to echo the concluding couplet of the
Shakespearean sixain.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f30.30">30</a><a name="f30" id="f30"></a>] Yet <strong>Dom Diego</strong> seems not to have been previously identified as a
minor epic. The late C. S. Lewis, a few pages before his brilliant
discussion of <strong>Hero and Leander</strong> as an epyllion, refers to Lynche's poem
as a "stanzaic <strong>novella</strong>." See Lewis' <strong>English Literature in the

Cambridge, from the Edward Capell collection. According to Mr. L.W.
Hanson, Keeper of Printed Books at the Bodleian, the tipping of the
type in the Bodleian copy represents a fault at binding.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f43.43">43</a><a name="f43" id="f43"></a>] Though the printer's name is not given, the printer's device, a
fleur-de-lis, no. 251 in McKerrow, was used by Okes about this time.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f44.44">44</a><a name="f44" id="f44"></a>] Grosart, p. xiii, n. 17, stanza 20, line 7, which has
"adoration[e]" in both the original and Grosart's "corrected" version,
and p. xiii, n. 19, stanza 41, line 6, "graces" in both copies.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f45.45">45</a><a name="f45" id="f45"></a>] The printer was Thomas Creede, as revealed by the printer's
device, no. 299 in McKerrow, p. 117: "Framed device of Truth being
scourged by a hand from the clouds. Between her feet the initials T.
C. The motto Viressit vulnere veritas."</p>

<p>[<a href="#f46.46">46</a><a name="f46" id="f46"></a>] The presence of these dedicatory verses in the Huntington copy
has been noted by Franklin Williams in his <strong>Index of Dedications and
Commendatory Verses</strong> (London, 1962), p. 193.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f47.47">47</a><a name="f47" id="f47"></a>] The Folger copy, here reproduced, is complete except for Sig. L4
(<ins class="correction" title="Original reads p. 235-236"><a href="#Page_214">pp. 214</a></ins>), which have been supplied from another copy.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f48.48">48</a><a name="f48" id="f48"></a>] This error goes back to the first entry in <strong>A Catalogue of the
Library of Henry Huth</strong> (London, 1880), which says the second edition is
the same as the first.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f49.49">49</a><a name="f49" id="f49"></a>] The first word of the next stanza is changed from "And" in the
1613 edition to "Then" in the second impression.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f50.50">50</a><a name="f50" id="f50"></a>] Rather surprisingly, in view of its silent emulation of Marlowe's
poem, <strong>Philos and Licia</strong> pays lavish tribute to Sidney. But since
tributes to Sidney were common in the period, this one may be no more
than a conventional recognition of his greatness.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f51.51">51</a><a name="f51" id="f51"></a>] Occasionally, though, it introduces odd off-rhymes such as
"forth" and "mouth" (<a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>), "vaines" and "streames" (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>), "either"
and "fairer" (<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>).</p>

Hasted to tell his Loue that it was morne.<br />
The milke-white path that leadeth vnto <i>Ioue</i>,<br />
Whereon the Gods continually doe moue,<br />
Compar'd with that, which leadeth to her bed,<br />
Was not so white, nor so enameled.<br />
A paire of milke-white staires, whiter than white,<br />

Vp those he mounted; and as by he paste,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Vpon a wall were sundry stories plaste:<br />
Sweet weeping <i>Venus</i>, crying out amaine<br />
For the dear boy that by the bore was slaine:<br />
Skie-ruling <i>Ioue</i> lamenting ore a Cow,<br />
That seemd to weepe with him the sweetest <i>Io</i>:<br />
And there the picture of proud <i>Phaeton</i>,<br />
Mounting the chariot of the burning Sun,<br />
Was portraied, by which <i>Apollo</i> stood,<br />
Who seemd to check his hot sonnes youthful blood:<br />
One hand had holde, and one legge was aduanst,<br />
To climbe his longing seat; but yet it chanst,<br />
That warned by his father so, he staid<br />
A while, to heare whose teeres might well perswade;<br />
Which with such plenty answerd his desires,<br />
As though they striu'd to quench ensuing fires:<br />
Hanging so liuely on the painted wall,<br />
That standers by haue sought to make them fall.<br />
The chamber, where his hearts delight did lie,<br />
Was all behung with richest Tapistrie;<br />
Where Troies orethrow was wrought, &amp; therwithall<br />
The goddesses dissent about the ball.<br />
Bloud-quaffing <i>Hector</i> all in compleat steele,<br />
Coping <i>Achilles</i> in the Troian feeld,<br />
Redoubling so his sterne stroaks on his head,<br />

Which was so liuely by the Painter done,<br />

Trecherous <i>Vlysses</i> bringing in that horse,<br />
Which proued a fatall coffin for Troies corse.<br />
False-hearted <i>Synon</i> groueling on the mire,<br />
Whose oily words prou'd fewell to Troies fire.<br />
Flint-brested <i>Pyrrhus</i> with an iron mace<br />
Murdring the remnants of great <i>Priams</i> race.<br />
Vertuous <i>&AElig;neas</i>, with the armes of Greece,<br />
Venturing for <i>Troy</i> as <i>Iason</i> for his fleece.<br />
And vpward if you lookt, you might behold<br />
The roofe of it all wrought in burnisht gold:<br />
Whereon was figur'd heauen; and there anent<br />
The Gods in state riding to Parliament.<br />
Gold-showring <i>Ioue</i> vpon a milke-white steed<br />
Rode first in ranke; on whose imperiall head<br />
A triple crowne was plac't, at which before<br />
Two matchlesse diamonds for worth he wore:<br />
On whose right hand <i>Idalian Ganymed</i><br />
A massie scepter strongly carried:<br />
But on his left, swift-winged <i>Mercurie</i><br />
A dreadfull thunderbolt (earths feare) did whurrie.<br />
Next <i>Ioue</i>, <i>Apollo</i> came: him followed <i>Fame</i><br />
Baring a lawrell, on which sweet <i>Sydneys</i> name<br />
In golden letters, plainly to be read,<br />
By the Nine Muses had beene charrectred:<br />
On whose each side Eternitie and Praise<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Enroll'd mens deeds, and gaue them fame to raise.<br />
Then furious <i>Mars</i> came next with sulphure eies,<br />
Flashing forth fire as lightning from the skies;<br />
Whose vncontrolled crest and battered shield<br />
Greeke-wounding <i>Hector</i> and <i>&AElig;neas</i> held.<br />
Light-headed <i>Bacchus</i> with a cup of golde<br />
Brimfull of wine, next <i>Mars</i> his place did holde;<br />
The which quaft off, one reeling on before<br />
Filled againe, and still supplied more.<br />
Him followed sicknesse, by excesse, being lead,<br />
With faint weake hands holding his pained head.<br />
Thus was the roofe adorn'd: but for the bed,<br />
The which those sacred limmes encanaped,<br />
I could say much: yet poised with her selfe,<br />
That gorgeous worke did seeme but drossy pelfe.<br />
All-conquering Loue inspire my weaker Muse,<br />
And with thy iocund smiles daigne to infuse<br />
Heauen-prompted praises to my vntaught story,<br />
That I may write her worth, and tell thy glory.<br />
Vpon her backe she lay (&ocirc; heauenly blisse!);<br />
Smiling like <i>Ioue</i>, being couzend of a kisse;<br />
The enuious pillow, which did beare her head,<br />
Was with it selfe at warre, and mutined:<br />
For if the midst receiu'd her chaste impression,<br />
Then the two ends would swell at such a blessing;<br />
And if she chanst to turne her head aside,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Gracing one end with natures only pride,<br />
The rest for enuy straight would swell so much,<br />
As it would leape asunder for a touch.<br />
Her Sun-out-shining eyes were now at set,<br />
Yet somewhat sparkling through their cabinet;<br />
Her scorne white forehead was made vp by nature,<br />
To be a patterne to succeeding creature<br />
Of her admiring skill: her louely cheeke,<br />
To Rose, nor Lyllie, will I euer leeke,<br />
Whose wondrous beautie had that boy but prou'd,<br />
Who died for loue, and yet not any lou'd,<br />
Neuer had riuer beene adorned so,<br />
To burie more then all the world could shew.<br />
Her sweetest breath from out those sweeter lips,<br />
Much like coole winde which from the valleys skips<br />
In parching heat of Summer, stealeth forth,<br />
Wandring amongst her haire; her wel formd mouth:<br />
No art hath left vs such proportion,<br />
To modell out so true perfection.<br />
Her smoothe moist hands the sheets kept from his sight,<br />
Lest by comparing, they should staine their white.<br />
As thus she lay like <i>Venus</i> in her pride,<br />
(Tempting sweet <i>Adon</i>, lowring by her side)<br />
<i>Philos</i> approcht, who with this sight strooke dumbe<br />
Came stealing on to see, and being come,<br />
His greedie eye, which on the sudden meets<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>So many various and delicious sweets,<br />
As rackt with pleasure (neuer hauing fill)<br />
Would faine looke off, and yet would looke on still.<br />
Thus do we surfet on our sudden ioyes,<br />
And ranck-fed pleasure thus it selfe destroyes:<br />
For when his eye doth light vpon her hand,<br />
He then protests, that that is whitenesse land;<br />
But when the whitenesse of her whiter brow<br />
Doth steale his eye from thence, he sweareth now<br />
Her brow is fellowlesse without all peere;<br />
When being snatcht off vnto her fairer haire,<br />
He vowes, the Sun, which makes trees burnisht gold,<br />
Is not so faire, nor glorious to behold:<br />
The viewing the strains which through those cheeks appeare,<br />
And that pure whitenesse which triumpheth there,<br />
Mixt with those azure Saphire passing vaines,<br />
Which are insert like siluer running streames,<br />
Watring those golden apples of the brests,<br />
Where heauens delight &amp; earths contentment rests,<br />
His full-fed eye orecome with such excesse,<br />
Sweares and forsweares, denies and doth confesse:<br />
Then doth he touch her lips, Natures rich treasure,<br />
And musing thinks which is the greatest pleasure<br />
To kisse or see; for to resolue which doubt,<br />
Againe he kisses, whence comes stealing out<br />
So sweet a breath as doth confound his sence;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>For rarest obiects hurt with excellence:<br />
Then doth he seise her hand with softest straine,<br />
Whose moist rebound doth easily detaine<br />
A willing guest, who purposely could wish<br />
Noother food, but such a well-grac't dish.<br />
Whiles thus poore <i>Philos</i> kisses, feeles and sees,<br />
Heauen-staining <i>Licia</i> opes her sparkling eyes,<br />
And askt the hopelesse Louer, if mornes eye<br />
Had out-stript night. <i>Philos</i> made answer, I.<br />
And thus the Louer did continuallie:<br />
For why, such lustre glided from her eie,<br />
Which darkt the Sun, whose glory all behold,<br />
So that she knew not day, till some man told.<br />
Which office she to <i>Philos</i> had assign'd,<br />
Because she had him alwayes most in mind:<br />
Which had he knowne, he would not so haue spent<br />
The restlesse nights in drery languishment,<br />
Tumbling and tossing in his lothsome bed,<br />
To flie from griefe, yet that still followed.<br />
Then rising vp, and running here and there,<br />
As if he could outrun or lose his care;<br />
But being vp, and finding no reliefe,<br />
Lookt in his heart, and there he found out griefe.<br />
How cam'st thou hither (then amaine he cries)<br />
To kil my heart? Griefe answerd, Through his eyes.<br />
Mine eyes (quoth he) subornd to murder me?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Well, for their treason they no more shall see.<br />
With that a floud of teeres gush out amaine;<br />
But griefe sends sighs to beat them backe againe:<br />
So that the hurt he meant to do his eies,<br />
Heart-murdring griefe resists, and it denies.<br />
Whereat amazd, as one bereft of sence,<br />
His eies fixt fast on her, as if from thence<br />
His soule had gone, he cri'd: &ocirc;h, let this moue,<br />
Loue me for pitie, or pitie me for loue.<br />
Though I am blacke, yet do me not despise,<br />
Loue looks as sweet in blacke as faire mens eies.<br />
The world may yeeld one fairer to your view;<br />
Not all the world fairer in loue to you.<br />
A iewell dropt in mire to sight ilfauoured,<br />
Now, as before, in worth is valued;<br />
An orient pearle hung in an Indians eare,<br />
Receiues no blemish, but doth shew more faire;<br />
One Diamond, compared with another,<br />
Darks his bright lustre, &amp; their worth doth smother;<br />
Where poised with a thing of light esteeme,<br />
Their worth is knowen, and their great beauty seene.<br />
Set white to white, and who commendeth either?<br />
Set white to blacke, and then the white's the fairer.<br />
The glorious Sunne, when in his glittring pride,<br />
Scowring the heauens, in progresse he doth ride,<br />
Who runnes to see? or who his sight doth lacke?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>But if he chance to shute himselfe in blacke,<br />
Then the earths people couet him to see,<br />
As if he were some wondrous prodegie.<br />
The worlds perfection, at the highest rated,<br />
Was of a blacke confused thing created.<br />
The sight, wherewith such wonders we behold,<br />
The ground of it all darke, and blacke the mold.<br />
Since then by blacke, perfection most is knowne,<br />
Loue, if not for my sake, yet for your owne.<br />
Mole gracing <i>Venus</i> neuer shewed so faire,<br />
When as <i>Vulcan</i> the black-fac'd god was there,<br />
As thou by me: the people, as we pace,<br />
By my defects shall wonder at thy grace;<br />
And seeing me so swarthie and so tawnie,<br />
Shall haue more cause for to admire thy beautie:<br />
And all shall thinke (by whom our charriots go)<br />
That tis thy beautie which hath tann'd me so.<br />
Thy dangling tresses, if compar'd with mine,<br />
Glitter like heauen with lustre from thine eine:<br />
And those immortall eies, which like the Sunne,<br />
The lookers on with his bright rayes doth burne,<br />
If mine be nie, will seeme to shine more cleere,<br />

For well she knew, that some nights did present<br />
As pleasing visions to her owne content;<br />
Yet in the morne, when golden sleepe had left her,<br />
Of her supposed ioyes it had bereft her.<br />
With this conceit, her iuory hand put forth,<br />
Drawes wide the curtaines which eclips'd her worth,<br />
And then she surely thinks she sees his face,<br />

Though farre too worthy for so meane a groome,<br />
That thine owne voice may swanlike (ere I die)<br />
Relate the storie of my miserie.<br />
Poore <i>Licia</i> fain would speake, &amp; faine would tell him<br />
He needs not doubt, for she well doth loue him;<br />
Yet fearing he (as Chapmen vse to doo)<br />
Would hold aloofe, if Sellers gin to woo,<br />
Her tongue entreats of her vnwilling heart,<br />
She may a while forbeare, and not impart<br />
Her loue-sicke passions to his couetous minde,<br />
Lest he disdainfull proue, and so vnkinde.<br />
O wonder worker (Loue) how thou doest force<br />
Our selues against our selues! and by that course<br />
Seem'st to erect great Trophies in our brests,<br />
By which thou tak'st away our easefull rests,<br />
Nurse to thy passions, making seeming-hate<br />
Fewell to loue, and iealousie the bate<br />
To catch proud hearts, fearefull suspition<br />
Being forerunner to thy passion!<br />
Who most doth loue, must seeme most to neglect it,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>For he that shews most loue, is least respected.<br />
What vertue is inioyd, thats not esteemd;<br />
But what meane good we want, thats highly deemd:<br />
Which is the cause that many men do rate<br />
Their owne wiues vertues at a meane estate;<br />
Their matchlesse beautie and vnualued worth<br />
Seemes nothing in their eyes, nor bringeth forth<br />
Effects of loue, when to a meaner farre,<br />
Whose birth nor beautie comparable are;<br />
With that he's cloid, his passions will admire<br />
The very place whereon her footsteps were.<br />
The life of sweets is kild without varietie,<br />
One beautie still enioyd, breeds loathd satietie;<br />
And kindnesse, whose command lies in our power,<br />
We seldome relish; but if labourd for,<br />
Our very soule is rauisht with delight,<br />
It is so pleasing to our appetite.<br />
Vrg'd by these reasons, she would faine conceale<br />
The hid affection which her heart did feele;<br />
And yet compassion of her louers state<br />
(Whose outward habit shewd his inward fate)<br />
Perswade with her to lend him some by-taste,<br />
Lest through his loues griefe she his loues life waste.<br />
Thrise happy daies (quoth she) and too soone gone,<br />
When as the deed was coupled with the tongue,<br />
And no deceitfull flattry nor guile<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Hung on the Louers teere-commixed stile;<br />
When now-scornd vertue was the golden end,<br />
By which all actions were performd and scand;<br />
And nothing glorious held, but what was free<br />
From vassall guilt and staind impietie.<br />
In those gold-times poore maidens might relie<br />
(Heauens sweetest treasure, dearer chastitie)<br />
Vpon mens words: but since that age is fled,<br />
And that the staining of a lawfull bed<br />
Is youths best grace, and all his oaths and passion<br />
Must still be taken on him as a fashion,<br />
To busie idle heads: &ocirc;h, who can blame<br />
If maids grow chary, since slie men want shame!<br />
Say I should loue, and yet I know not why<br />
I should make any such supposes, I;<br />
Not that I am of such relentlesse temper,<br />
Whose heart nor vowes, nor sighs, nor teeres can enter;<br />
Nor am I only she, who thinks it good<br />
To sprinckle Loues rites with their Louers blood.<br />
Poore women neuer yet in loue offended,<br />
But that too quicke to loue they condescended:<br />
Their fault is pitie, which beleeues too soone<br />
Mens heart void tongue-delighted passion.<br />
Could women learne but that imperiousnesse,<br />
By which men vse to stint our happinesse,<br />
When they haue purchac'd vs for to be theirs<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>By customary sighs and forced teeres,<br />
To giue vs bits of kindnesse lest we faint,<br />
But no abundance; so we euer want,<br />
And still are begging, which too well they know<br />
Endeares affection, and doth make it grow.<br />
Had we these sleights, how happy were we then,<br />
That we might glory ouer loue-sicke men!<br />
But arts we know not, nor haue any skill<br />
To faine a sower looke to a pleasing will;<br />
Nor couch our secretst loue in shew of hate:<br />
But if we like, must be compassionate.<br />
Say that thy teere-discoloured cheeke should moue<br />
Relenting pitie and that long liu'd loue.<br />
If ere thy faith should alter, and become<br />
Stranger to that which now it oft hath sworne,<br />
How were I wrapt in woe! No time to be<br />
Would euer end my datelesse miserie.<br />
Ay me (quoth <i>Philos</i>) what man can despise<br />
Such amourous looks, sweet tongues, &amp; most sweet eies?<br />
Or who is glutted with the sight of heauen,<br />
Where still the more we looke, the more is seene?<br />
To the world of beauties Nature lent,<br />
And in each beautie worlds of loues content,<br />
Wherein delight and state moues circuler,<br />
Pleasure being captaine to thy Hemisphere.<br />
Say that the eie, wandring through white and red,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Long hauing viewd Loues tower, thy wel built head,<br />
Passing those iuory walks where gentlest aire<br />
Fannes the sweet tresses of thy scorn-gold haire,<br />
Admiring oft those redder strawberries,<br />
Ript by the Sun-shine of thy loue-blest eyes,<br />
Should in this maze of pleasure, being led,<br />
Grow weary, with much time satisfied:<br />
Then might the eare be rapt with melodie<br />
Surpassing farre the seuen-spheard harmonie<br />
Deliuerd from thy pearle-enuirond tongue,<br />
Each word being sweeter then a well tun'd song.<br />
But for the touch, all ages that are past,<br />
And times to come, would steale away, and waste<br />
Euen like a minute; and no time suffice<br />
To melt the Louer in such rarities:<br />
Each day would adde to other such excesse<br />
Of Nectar-flowing sweets, that Happinesse<br />
Would be too meane a word for to dilate<br />
The enuied blisse of his vnequall state.<br />
No more (quoth <i>Licia</i>) thou enough hast sayd<br />
Fo to deceiue a sillie witted maid:<br />
But to the God of Loue I will reueale,<br />
How that thou keepst a tongue maids harts to steale,<br />
Whose fatall arrow with the golden head,<br />
Which (as some write) makes all enamoured,<br />
May be compared well (without offence)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Vnto thy sweet tongue guilt with eloquence,<br />
Whose powrfull accents, so constraining loue,<br />
Had they beene knowen to Thunder-darting <i>Ioue</i>,<br />
He neuer needed to haue vs'd such shapes<br />
For to commit his slie stolne headdy rapes:<br />
Or to <i>Apollo</i>, when his harebraind sonne,<br />
The proud aspiring lucklesse <i>Phaeton</i>,<br />
Would guide the lampe of heauen he then had staid,<br />
And to his Sires graue counsels had obaid:<br />
Beast-mouing <i>Orpheus</i>, and stones void of sence,<br />
Ore which his musicke had preheminence,<br />
Did not inchant so by his power diuine,<br />
As doth that Adamantine tongue of thine.<br />
Iudge me not light, that I so soone do yeeld<br />
To part from that which I so deerely held;<br />
For where a likely beautie doth request,<br />
Euen at the first, Loue ransacketh the brest:<br />
And though maids seem coy, yet the heart is strooke<br />
At the first glancing of an amourous looke:<br />
For from the Louer to the loued eie<br />
Passeth the visuall beames, which gendred nie<br />
Vnto the heart, they thither hie amaine,<br />
And there her bloud do secretly inflame<br />
With strange desires, faint hopes, and longing feares,<br />
Vnheard of wishes, thoughts begetting teares,<br />
That ere she is aware she's farre in loue,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Yet knowes no cause that should affection moue.<br />
I could be froward, techie, sullen, mute,<br />
And with loue-killing looks repell thy sute;<br />
Contemne the speaking letters which thou sends;<br />
Command thine absence, and reiect thy friends;<br />
Neglect thy presents, and thy vowes despise;<br />
And laughing at thy teeres, force teeres arise;<br />
Making thee spend a deale of precious time<br />
To get that heart which at the first was thine.<br />
More I could say. But he content with this,<br />
Closd vp the sentence with a sugred kisse.<br />
She seemd displeasd, till kissing her againe,<br />
<i>Achilles</i> like, he tooke away her paine:<br />
And then in close coucht termes would faine desire<br />
Loues highest blisse, than which there is no higher:<br />
But yet the bashfull boy knew not what art,<br />
What termes to vse, or how for to impart<br />
His secret meaning; for he blusht for shame<br />
To thinke what he should aske; &amp; then would faine<br />
Haue made his bolder hand supply the roome<br />
Of his tongues office, which was mute and dumbe;<br />
The which he layes vpon her siluer brest,<br />
Where little <i>Cupid</i> slumbring takes his rest;<br />
Betweene the which an amourous streame doth run,<br />
That leads the way vnto <i>Elysium</i>.<br />
I wonder much (quoth he) when <i>Ioue</i> did make<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>A treble night for faire <i>Alcmenaes</i> sake,<br />
She nere perceiued that the night was long,<br />
Since all eyes wait vpon the rising sunne:<br />
But sure some melting pleasure did detaine<br />
Her willing senses, and did so enchaine<br />
Her captiue minde, that time vnthought of fled,<br />
Long nights in sweets being swiftly buried.<br />
Might I such dalliance craue, as great <i>Ioue</i> did<br />
Of faire <i>Alcmena</i>; or when he lay hid<br />
In the swannes shape; how happy were I then,<br />
And how farre blest aboue all other men!<br />
For this, the gods themselues haue often woed,<br />
Courted, adored, kneeld vnto and sued,<br />
Left heauen, their glory, pompe and maiestie,<br />
And put aside their glittring deitie,<br />
To get this iewell, which yeelds true content.<br />
When that seuerer state perhaps gan ornament<br />
Of inward woe, let mortals be excus'd,<br />
When deities such amourous tricks haue vs'd.<br />
O wit abusing boy (sweet <i>Licia</i> cried;)<br />
The gods for that were neuer deified:<br />
Though they did vse it, and obserue it well,<br />
When ere they did it (as all Poets tell)<br />
They from their godheads long before were turnd,<br />
And to some monstrous beast they were transformd,<br />
And in that shape did act lasciuiousnesse:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>For lust transformes vs beasts, and no whit lesse<br />
Do we than they, but yet deserue more blame,<br />
We hauing reason, whose reproofe should tame<br />
Rebell-affection, and not to let it grow,<br />
To worke his owne vntimely ouerthrow.<br />
Insatiate lust as Spring-frosts nips the growth<br />
Of Natures fairest blossomes, crops the worth<br />
Of her best hopes, nay's foe vnto delight,<br />
Dulling the keene edge of our appetite,<br />
Whose rancke desire, much like the Ocean,<br />
Whose swelling ridges no bound can containe,<br />
Oreflowes whole sands, and in her emptie wombe<br />
Buries them all; Euen so doth lust intombe<br />
All disrancke thoughts, sin-breeding interuiewes,<br />
Disordred passions, all dishonest shewes<br />
Of what may fatten vice; like thriftlesse heires<br />
Lusts champians are, which kill their dearest Sires<br />
For their possessions, to giue both life and growth<br />
To helborne riot. So lasciuious youth,<br />
Courting our beauties, cares not to pollute<br />
Our soules for that, though left heauens substitute<br />
To bridle passion. Gentle boy refraine,<br />
And quench vnlawfull heat till <i>Hymens</i> flame<br />
With sacred fire hath warmd vs, and her rites<br />
Fully performd do warrant those delites.<br />
By this the Soueraigne of heauens flaming beame<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Had got the full height of the starrie heauen,<br />
And she requests the boy, that for a while<br />
He will depart the roome, she may beguile<br />
The clothes of her blest presence. He obaid,<br />
And in a chamber next to hers he staid.<br />
He being gone, the sheets away she flung,<br />
Which loth to let her go, about her clung;<br />
And as she stroue to get out from the sheet,<br />
The vpper clothes imprisond both her feet;<br />
Yet out she whips, and them away she throwes,<br />
Couering her beauties with the ioyfull clothes:<br />
Her purple veluet gowne with gold-starres mixt,<br />
And euery starre with spangles set betwixt<br />
Of purest siluer, with a twist of gold,<br />
Would much amaze the gazers to behold.<br />
This starrie garment did she first put on,<br />
Which tooke light from her face as from the Sun.<br />
Her mantle was of richest taffatie,<br />
Where <i>Iupiter</i> was seruing <i>Danae</i>,<br />
So liuely wrought by <i>Vestaes</i> chastest Nun,<br />
As much delighted the sweet lookers on.<br />
Her stomacher was all with diamonds set,<br />
Ore which a fall was plac'd with pearles with net,<br />
And at each pearle (which seemd to darke the skie)<br />
Hung glistring Rubies and rich Porpherie.<br />
A bracelet all of pearle her hands did grace;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>For to her hands all orients are but base.<br />
A scarfe of maiden-blush did seeme to hide her,<br />
Wherein <i>Diana</i> when <i>Acteon</i> spide her,<br />
Herselfe had wrought, looking with such disdaine,<br />
As witnest well his after-following paine;<br />
One end whereof had yong <i>Leanders</i> shape,<br />
When through the swelling main (whose waues did gape)<br />
He sought his chastest <i>Hero</i>, beating from him<br />
The waues, which murmuring stroue for to com nere him:<br />
And at the other, matchlesse <i>Hero</i> stood<br />
Viewing <i>Leander</i> tossed by the flood,<br />
And how the churlish billowes beat that head<br />
On which herselfe was so enamoured;<br />
Praying to <i>Neptune</i>, not to be so cruell,<br />
But to deliuer vp her dearest iewell:<br />
To figure to the world whose shining eies<br />
She set two diamonds of highest prise.<br />
Vpon her head she ware a vaile of lawne,<br />
Eclipsing halfe her eyes, through which they shone<br />
As doth the bright Sun, being shadowed<br />
By pale thin clouds, through which white streaks are spred.<br />
Poore <i>Philos</i> wondred why she staid so long,<br />
And oft lookt out and mus'd she did not come.<br />
What need she decke her selfe with art (quoth he)<br />
Or hide those beauties with her brauerie,<br />
Which addeth glory to the meanst attire?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>What if she went in her loose flagging haire,<br />
Spread at his full length, that the Easterne winde<br />
Might tie loue-knots for <i>Cupid</i> to vntwinde,<br />
With some trasparent garment ore her skin,<br />
Through which her naked glory might be seene:<br />
Then as <i>Diana</i> a hunting might she goe;<br />
But she nor needs her arrowes nor a bow:<br />
For all the beasts that should but see her passe,<br />
With w&#333;dring straight would leaue the perled grasse<br />
And feed their eyes, while with her snowy hand<br />
She take what beasts she please; nor more command<br />
Needs she to keepe them: for her iuory palme<br />
Commandeth more than any iron chaine.<br />
But now she's come, at whose thrise radiant light<br />
As all amazd he shunnes her glorious sight,<br />
Like those which long in darke, chance to espie<br />
A candles glimmering, if it come but nie,<br />
Can not endure that weake and feeble shine,<br />
But straightway shut their dim and dazled eine.<br />
No maruell then, though in great extasie<br />
His spirits are, at glittring maiestie.<br />
She feares the worst, and to her Louer skips,<br />
Claps his plumpe cheeks, and beats his corall lips,<br />
And seeing him fall breathlesse to the earth,<br />
She seeks with kisses to inspire his breath.<br />
At last his eye-lids he vp heaues againe,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>And feeling her sweet kisses, gins to faine;<br />
Shuts his bright eyes, and stops his rosie breath,<br />
And for her kisses counterfeits his death.<br />
With that poore <i>Licia</i> both her hands vpholds,<br />
And those let fall, her wofull armes enfolds,<br />
With cast vp eyes in labour with her teares,<br />
Which ioy did weep for woe to leaue those spheares<br />
Which downe her face made paths vnto her necke,<br />
And setling there shewd like a carquenet;<br />
Anon she teares her haire, away it flings,<br />
Which twining on her fingers shewd like rings;<br />
Then she assayes to speake, but sighs and teares<br />
Eats vp her words and multiplies her feares.<br />
Why wert thou borne (quoth she) to die so soone,<br />
And leaue the world poore of perfection;<br />
Or why did high heauen frame thee such a creature,<br />
So soone to perish: &ocirc; selfe-hurting Nature,<br />
Why didst thou suffer death to steale him hence,<br />
Who was thy glory and thy excellence.<br />
What are the Roses red, now he is gone,<br />
But like the broke sparks of a diamond,<br />
Whose scattred pieces shadow to the eye<br />
What the whole was, and adde to miserie?<br />
Such this faire casket of a fairer iem,<br />
Whose beautie matchlesse now, what was it then<br />
When that his precious breath gaue life and sent<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>To those dead flowers whose feruor now is spent?<br />
O starueling Death, thou ruiner of Kings,<br />
Thou foe to youth and beautie-sealed things,<br />
Thou friend to none but sepulchers and graues,<br />
High reared monuments, lasting Epitaphs,<br />
Poore Clearks &amp; Sextons, and some thriftlesse heires,<br />
Depriued Priests, and a few Courtiers,<br />
Who hauing liuings in reuersion,<br />
Do dayly pray for quicke possession;<br />
Who had offended thee, that blinde with rage<br />
Thou strookst at him, for whom succeeding age<br />
Will curse thy bones? Physitians be thy baine,<br />
And chase thee hence to lowest hell againe.<br />
He hearing this, from pleasing death reuiues,<br />
And drunke those teeres from her immortall eies,<br />
Which drop by drop sought other to displace,<br />
That each might kisse that sweet and daintie face.<br />
Nor doth the Soueraigne of heauens golden fires,<br />
After a storme so answer mens desires,<br />
When with a smiling countenance he orelooks<br />
The flowrie fields and siluer streaming brooks,<br />
As <i>Licia</i> in his life was comforted,<br />
Whom new before she thought for to be dead:<br />
She locks her fingers in his crisped haire,<br />
And pulles it out at length, which leauing there,<br />
The haire bands backe at it for ioy had leapt,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>To be a prisoner to hand so white:<br />
And then she stroaks his alabaster skin,<br />
And chucks the boy on his immortall chin,<br />
Glassing herselfe within his matchlesse eyes,<br />
Where little <i>Cupids</i> conquering forces lies.<br />
Faire Deere (quoth he) to night now wil I leaue you,<br />
But in your charge my heart I will bequeath you;<br />
Securely sleepe, lest in your troubled brest<br />
If you chance sigh, you keepe my heart from rest;<br />
Which I protest hath many a tedious night<br />
Counted times minutes for your absent sight:<br />
What for the nuptials will seeme requisit,<br />
That to your charge (faire creature) I commit,<br />
Which ere the bright Sun with his burning beame<br />
Hath twice more coold his tresses in the maine,<br />
Shall be performd. This sayd, away he's gone.<br />
Farewell (quoth she:) and at that word a groane<br />
Waited with sighs and teeres, which to preuent,<br />
For feare his sweet heart she should discontent,<br />
Vnto her needle in all haste she goes,<br />
For to beguile her passions and her woes.<br />
She first begins a smocke, of greater cost<br />
Than <i>Helen</i> wore that night when as she lost<br />
Her husbands fame and honour, and thereby<br />
Had almost kept our now lost dignitie:<br />
For <i>Paris</i> first, when as he came to bed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>On that rich smocke was so enamoured,<br />
And so attentiuely beheld the same,<br />
That he forgot almost for what he came:<br />
For on the coller and the seame before<br />
Was big-bon'd <i>Hercules</i> and the <i>Minetaure</i>,<br />
Both wrought so liuely, that the bloud which came<br />
From that deformed beast, did seeme to staine<br />
Her smocke below; which running here and there<br />
Workt in red silke, did new and fresh appeare;<br />
Which made yong <i>Paris</i> doubt, and thinke indeed<br />
She was not well, and askt and she did bleed;<br />
And would needs see: but wide the curtains drawn,<br />
There was some iewell sparkled through the lawn,<br />
Which pleasd him so, that he had quite forgot<br />
The curious working of the rich wrought smocke.<br />
But loue-blest <i>Licia</i> in her smocke delights<br />
To worke of pleasing tales and marriage rites,<br />
Of louers sweet stolne sports, and of the rapes<br />
Of gods immortall, and of maidens scapes:<br />
There might you see <i>Mars</i> conquering <i>Venus</i> shrowd,<br />
Sea-torne <i>&AElig;neas</i> in a foggie cloud<br />
Making for Carthage; entring all vnseene<br />
To the rich temple where the Tyrian Queene<br />
(Flashing forth beautie from her star-like eies)<br />
Sate in her throne to heare the Troians cries.<br />
Beneath this same she wrought a boistrous storme,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Whereas the mercy-wanting winds had torne<br />
The tops of loftie trees, and rent the roots<br />
Of stately Cedars and of aged oakes:<br />
The horrid thunder with his dreadfull claps<br />
Made yawn the mouth of heauen, from whose great gaps<br />
The fearefull lightning flasht: and then againe<br />
<i>Ioue</i> squeesd the clouds, &amp; powrd down snow &amp; rain.<br />
In this same storme she wrought the Tyrian Queene<br />
And great <i>&AElig;neas</i>, who that day had beene<br />
Hunting the fallow deere, and thither camex<br />
To shrowd themselues from tempest and raine.<br />
Into a bushie caue hard by they got,<br />
Which thicke set trees did couer ore the top;<br />
In which the Carthage Queene <i>&AElig;neas</i> led,<br />
Who there deceiu'd her of her maidenhead.<br />
A scarfe besides she made of cunning frame,<br />
Whereas <i>Alcides</i> club and armour throwne,<br />
His lion skin put off, in maids attire<br />
He grad the wheele at <i>Omphales</i> desire.<br />
And all this night she banisht sleepe by worke,<br />
Who in her chamber priuily did lurke,<br />
Tempting her eye-lids to conspire with him,<br />
Who often times would winke and ope again:<br />
But now bright <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> in his burning car<br />
Visits each mortall eye and dimmes each star,<br />
The nights sole watch-man, when she casts aside<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Her curious worke, and doth in haste prouide:<br />
For the faire fountaine which not far off stands,<br />
Whose purling noise vpon the golden sands<br />
Inuites each weary wandring passenger<br />
To see and taste those streames which are so cleare.<br />
The louing banks like armes seeme to embrace it,<br />
Vpon the which there grew (the more to grace it)<br />
All sorts of coloured flowers, which seemd to looke<br />
And glasse themselues within that siluer brooke.<br />
Plentie of grasse did euery where appeare,<br />
Nurst by the moisture of the running riuer,<br />
Which euer flourishing still a beautious greene,<br />
Shewd like the palace of the Summers Queene:<br />
For neither frost nor cold did nip those flowers,<br />
Nor Sunburnt Autumne parch those leafie bowers:<br />
And as she goes to bathe, the tender grasse<br />
Twineth about her, loth to let her passe:<br />
Here loue-strucke brambles plucke her by the gown,<br />
There roses kisse her as she walks along.<br />
When being come vnto the riuer side,<br />
Looking about, for feare she should be spide,<br />
She stript her naked, standing on the brinke,<br />
When the deere water, who ten yeeres did thinke<br />
Till she was in, conspired with the banke,<br />
That downe it fell, and all vnwares she sanke<br />
Vp to the brests; then it inclos'd her round,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Kisses each part, and from the purling ground<br />
The vnder-streames made haste to come and view<br />
Those beauties which no earth could euer shew.<br />
The slimy fishes with their watry finnes<br />
Stand gazing on her, and close by her swimmes,<br />
And as she mou'd they mou'd, she needs no bait,<br />
For as when <i>Orpheus</i> plaid, so do they wait.<br />
And purple <i>Titan</i>, whom some fogs did shrowd,<br />
Perforce brake forth from his imprisond cloud<br />
To gaze vpon her, whose reflecting beames<br />
When hot she felt, she leaues the watry streames;<br />
Which they perceiuing, lessened her strength,<br />
To make her stay; yet out she got at length:<br />
For which the waters are at enmitie<br />
With the Sunnes bright and glorious maiestie,<br />
And euery morning, ere <i>Apollo</i> rise,<br />
They send blacke vapours vp to his darke eies,<br />
And maske his beautie, that he be not seene<br />
To hinder them of such a blessed blessing.<br />
Now vp she gets, and homeward fast she goes,<br />
And by the way is musing of the ioyes<br />
To morrowes day should yeeld, and wisht it come;<br />
But her swift wishes ouergoe the Sunne,<br />
Which to her thinking, like a tired man<br />
Heauily loaden, vp a hill doth come.<br />
Ay me (quoth she) had <i>Thetis Daphnes</i> grace,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Then wouldst thou ierke thy horses, and apace<br />
Scowre through the azurd skie: but for she's old,<br />
Wanting white snowy armes for to enfold<br />
Thy golden body, therefore thou doest moue<br />
(As though new parted from some amorous loue)<br />
Not like a man trudging with more than haste,<br />
That he might clip his louers melting waste.<br />
Were I the ruler of that fierie teame,<br />
Bloud would I fetch, and force them leape amaine<br />
Into the sea, and ouerspread the skie<br />
With pitchie clouds, their darkesome liuerie.<br />
Yet home she hies in hope to finde the boy<br />
Which soone would turne those sorrowes into ioy:<br />
But he was absent; for much time he spent<br />
To make his horse fit for the Turnament,<br />
Which with his curtelax and drery lance<br />
He meant to holde her beautie to aduance:<br />
When missing him, she knew not how to spend<br />
The weary day, nor bring it to end;<br />
But calls her maid to beare her companie,<br />
And willed her to tell some historie<br />
Which she had read or heard, to mocke the time;<br />
Who with a sober smile did thus beginne:<br />
In Crete there dwelt a boy of so good grace,<br />
So wondrous beautie, such a louely face,<br />
An eye so liuely, such a cherrie lip,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>So white a belly and so strait a hip,<br />
So well shapt, faire, in euery part and lim,<br />
That Nature was in loue with making him.<br />
This boy would oft resort vnto the Lawnes,<br />
To rouse the Satyres and the nimble fawnes,<br />
That he might chase them; but the fearefull deere<br />
Loue-taken by his presence, would not stirre:<br />
So he was faine (when he would haue some play)<br />
Himselfe to run, and then they scud away<br />
And follow him, and in the place he stands<br />
Come lightly tripping for to licke his hands:<br />
And if the lion chanst for to espie him,<br />
He would away, looke back, but not come nie him,<br />
Lest he should feare him, and complaine of Nature,<br />
That she had made him such a horrid creature,<br />
And wish himselfe to be the gentle hare,<br />
The timorous sheepe, or any beast that were,<br />
So he might gaze on him, and not beasts king,<br />
To be depriu'd of so endeerd a blessing.<br />
And many times the wood nymph in a ring<br />
Would girt the boy about, and being hemd in,<br />
Ere he get out, a kisse to each must giue,<br />
Or being so inchaind, so must he liue.<br />
As thus the boy did often times resort<br />
Vnto the woods to finde some friendly sport,<br />
One day amongst the rest he chanst to spie<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>A virgin huntresse comming that way by,<br />
With light thin garments tuckt vp to the knees,<br />
Buskins about her legs, through which he sees<br />
A skin so white, that neuer did his eie<br />
Beholde so chaste, so pure, so sweet a die:<br />
Her vpper bodies when he did beholde,<br />
They seemd all glistring to be made of gold,<br />
But he perceiued, being somewhat nere,<br />
It was the beautie of her dangling haire,<br />
Which from her head hung downe vnto her waste,<br />
And such a bright and orient colour cast.<br />
About her necke she ware a precious stone,<br />
A high pris'd, matchlesse, sparkling diamond,<br />
But poising it with her transpiercing eye,<br />
Shewd like a candle when the Sun is by.<br />
The louely boy was taken with the hooke,<br />
The more he gazd, the more still was he strooke;<br />
A thousand amourous glances he doth throwe,<br />
And those recoild, seconds a thousands moe.<br />
At last the boy being danted by her feature,<br />
Makes his speech prologue to so admir'd a creature:<br />
Celestiall goddesse, sprung from heauenly race,<br />
<i>Ioues</i> sweetest offpring, shew me but what place<br />
Thou doest inhabit, where thy Temple stands,<br />
That I may offer with vnspotted hands<br />
On thy deere Altar; and vpon thy praise<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Sing glorious hymnes and sweet tun'd roundelays;<br />
But &ocirc; most happy if I were thy Priest,<br />
To celebrate thy vigils and thy feast.<br />
If it be <i>Paphos</i> and thou loues sweet Queene,<br />
Rose cheekt <i>Adonis</i> would that I had beene;<br />
Or if nights gouernesse, the pale-fac'd Moone,<br />
For thy sake would I were <i>Endymion</i>:<br />
But if no goddesse, yet of heauenly birth,<br />
And not disdainst poore men that liue on earth,<br />
If thou hast any Loue, would I were he,<br />
Or if thou wantst one, fix thy loue on me.<br />
With that she blusht, and smiling lookt vpon him;<br />
But here she left: for <i>Philos</i> comming in,<br />
Brake off her tale, and then they all deuise<br />
For state and show, how they may solemnise<br />
Their nuptials: each minute seemes a day,<br />
Till the slow houres had stolne the night away:<br />
But morne being come, theres none can tell the blis<br />
That they conceiu'd, without the like were his.<br />
The golden Sun did cherish vp the day,<br />
And chas'd the foggie mists and slime away,<br />
And gentle <i>Zephyre</i> with perfumed breath<br />
Stealing the sweets from off the flowry earth,<br />
Doth mildly breathe among the enamord trees,<br />
Kissing their leafie locks, which like still seas<br />
Waue vp and downe: and on the sprigs there stood<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>The feathred Quiristers of the shadowy wood,<br />
Warbling forth layes of piercing melodie,<br />
Measuring the dances of the wind-wau'd tree.<br />
Swift-winged <i>Mercurie</i> hearing the report<br />
Of these same nuptials, trudg'd vnto the Court,<br />
And there vnto the bench of Deities<br />
Vnfolds this newes, who altogether rise,<br />
And on the battlements of the azure skie<br />
They seat themselues to see these two passe by.<br />
Afore him went a troupe of gallant youth,<br />
Of the best feature and of perfect growth;<br />
He followed in a cloake of cloth of gold,<br />
Larded with pearles, with diamonds enrold;<br />
His vpper vestment was cut out in starres,<br />
(Such wore great <i>Mars</i> when as he left the warres,<br />
And courted <i>Venus</i>) vnder which was drawne<br />
Cloth all of tyssue couered ore with lawne.<br />
Next came the Bride, like to the Queene of light,<br />
Drawne by her dragons to adorne the night:<br />
When she is richly dect and all things on,<br />
Going to court her sweet <i>Endymion</i>,<br />
Attended by a shining companie<br />
Of louely damsels, who together hie<br />
Vnto the Temple, where the sacred Priest<br />
In all his hallowed vestments being drest,<br />
With each consent, ioyning the louers hands,<br />
Knit them together in <i>Hymens</i> sacred bands.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">1</span><br />
<br />
<big>N</big><span class="smcap">e</span>ere to the place where <i>Nilus</i> channels runne,<br />
There stood a town by loue long since vndone;<br />
For by a chance that hapned in the same,<br />
The town's forgot, &amp; with the towne the name.<br />
Within which towne (for then it was a towne)<br />
Dwelt two commanders of no small renowne,<br />
Daughter to one, was <i>Thisbe</i> smooth as glasse:<br />
Fairer then <i>Thisbe</i> never woman was.<br />
Sonne to the other, <i>Pyramus</i> the bright:<br />
Yong <i>Thisbes</i> play-feare, <i>Thisbe</i> his delight:<br />
Both firme in loue, as constant and were any,<br />
Both crost in loue, as proud Loue crosseth many.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">2</span><br />
<br />
For in the pride of sommers parching heat,<br />
When children play and dally in the street,<br />
Yong <i>Thisbe</i> seuerd from the common sort,<br />
As gentle nurture lothes each rusticke sport,<br />
Went to an arbour, arbours then were greene,<br />
Where all alone, for feare she should be seene,<br />
She gatherd violets and the Damaske rose,<br />
And made sweet nosegaies, from the which she chose,<br />
One of the sweetest. Sweet were all the rest,<br />
But that which pleasd her wanton eye the best.<br />
And this (quoth she) shall be my true loues fauor:<br />
Her tender nonage did of true love sauor.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">3</span><br />
<br />
No sooner spake, but at her speech she blusht:<br />
For on the sudden <i>Pyramus</i> in rusht,<br />
Hauing but newly cropt the spredding pine,<br />
And other branches that were greene and fine,<br />
Of which to passe his idle time away,<br />
The boy made wreaths and garlands that were gay,<br />
And spying <i>Thisbe</i>, <i>Thisbe</i> made him start,<br />
And he her blush, so tender was her heart:<br />
She blusht, because another was so neere,<br />
He started, for to finde another there;<br />
Yet looking long, at last they knew each other,<br />
For why, they lov'd like sister and like brother.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">4</span><br />
<br />
When they left looking, for they lookt awhile,<br />
First <i>Pyramus</i>, last <i>Thisbe</i> gan to smile,<br />
I was afraide, thus <i>Thisbe</i> straight began:<br />
Faint (he replied) a maid and feare a man?<br />
I feard (quoth she) but now my feare is past.<br />
Then welcome me (quoth <i>Pyramus</i>) at last.<br />
Welcome (quoth she) and then she kist his lips,<br />
And he from her, sweet <i>Nectar</i> drops out sips:<br />
She pats his lips, he puls her milke white skin.<br />
Thus children sport, and thus true loue begins:<br />
But they as children, not as louers gamed,<br />
For loue (alas) twixt them was neuer named.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">5</span><br />
<br />
Oft would he take her by the lillie hand,<br />
Cirkling her middle, straight as any wand,<br />
And cast her downe, but let her lye alone,<br />
For other pastime <i>Pyramus</i> knew none.<br />
Then vp she starts and takes him by the necke,<br />
And for that fall giues <i>Pyramus</i> a checke:<br />
Yet at the length she chanst to cast him downe,<br />
Though on the green she neuer gaind a gowne,<br />
But rose againe, and hid her in the grasse,<br />
That he might tract the place where <i>Thisbe</i> was,<br />
And finding her (as children vse) imbrace her,<br />
For being children nothing could disgrace her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">6</span><br />
<br />
But marke the issue, of their sportiue play,<br />
As this sweet couple in the coole shade lay,<br />
Faire <i>Venus</i> posting whom to <i>Paphos</i> Ile,<br />
Spied their sports, nor could she chuse but smile,<br />
Wherefore she straight vnyok't her siluer teame,<br />
And walkt on foot along the Chrystall streame,<br />
And enuying that these louers were so bold,<br />
VVith iealous eyes she did them both behold.<br />
And as she lookt, casting her eye awry,<br />
It was her chance (vnhappy chance) to spy,<br />
VVhere squint-eyd <i>Cupid</i> sate vpon his quiuer,<br />
Viewing his none-eyd body in the riuer.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">7</span><br />
<br />
Him straight she cald, being cald he made no stay,<br />
But to his mother tooke the neerest way.<br />
Yet ere he came, she markt the tother two,<br />
Playing as oft tofore th'er wont to do:<br />
And then she sware, yong <i>Pyramus</i> was faire,<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> but browne, as common women are:<br />
Anon she wisht yong <i>Pyramus</i> was neere,<br />
That she might bind loue in his golden haire,<br />
And loue him too, but that she cald to mind,<br />
That yong <i>Adonis</i> proued so vnkinde.<br />
But <i>Cupid</i> came, his comming causd her hate them,<br />
And in a heat, proud <i>Venus</i> gan to rate them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">8</span><br />
<br />
Seest thou my sonne (quoth she) and then she fround,<br />
Those brattish elues, that dally on the ground?<br />
They scorne my kingdome, and neglect my minde,<br />
Contemne me as inconstant as the winde.<br />
Then shoot (quoth she) and strike them so in loue,<br />
As nought but death, their loue-dart may remoue.<br />
At this he lookt, the boy was loth to shoot,<br />
Yet strucke them both so neere the hearts sweet root,<br />
As that he made them both at once to cry<br />
(Quoth he) I loue, for loue (quoth she) I die.<br />
Of this both <i>Venus</i>, and her blind boy bosted,<br />
And thence to <i>Paphos</i> Isle in triumph posted.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">9</span><br />
<br />
Now was the time, when shepheards told their sheep,<br />
And weary plow-men ease themselues with sleepe,<br />
When loue-prickt <i>Thisbe</i> no where could be found,<br />
Nor <i>Pyramus</i>, though seruants sought them round.<br />
But newes came straight, that <i>Pyramus</i> was seene,<br />
Sporting with <i>Thisbe</i> lately in the euen:<br />
Like newes to both their Parents soone was brought;<br />
Which newes (alas) the louers downfals wrought.<br />
For though they lov'd, as you haue heard of yore,<br />
Their angry parents hate was ten times more,<br />
And hearing that their children were together,<br />
Both were afraide least each had murthered other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">10</span><br />
<br />
When they came home, as long they staid not forth,<br />
Their storming parents fround vpon them both,<br />
And charged them neuer so to meet againe,<br />
Which charge to them, God knows was endles paine:<br />
For yeres came on, and true loue tooke such strength,<br />
That they were welnigh slaine for loue at length:<br />
For though their parents houses ioynd in one,<br />
Yet they poore peats, were ioynd to liue alone.<br />
So great and deadly was the daring hate,<br />
Which kept their moody parents at debate,<br />
And yet their hearts as houses ioynd together,<br />
Though hard constraint, their bodies did disseuer.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">11</span><br />
<br />
At length they found, as searching louers find,<br />
A shift (though hard) which somwhat easd their mind:<br />
For Io a time worne creuis in the wall,<br />
Through this the louers did each other call,<br />
And often talke, but softly did they talke,<br />
Least busie spy-faults should find out their walke:<br />
For it was plast in such a secret roome,<br />
As thither did their parents seldome come.<br />
Through this they kist, but with their breath they kist,<br />
For why the hindring wall was them betwixt,<br />
Somtimes poor souls, they talkt till they were windles<br />
And all their talke was of their friends vnkindnes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">12</span><br />
<br />
When they had long time vsd this late found shift,<br />
Fearing least some should vndermine their drift,<br />
They did agree, but through the wall agreed,<br />
That both should hast vnto the groue with speed,<br />
And in that arbour where they first did meet,<br />
With semblant loue each should the other greet,<br />
The match concluded, and the time set downe,<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> prepar'd to get her forth the towne,<br />
For well she wot, her loue would keepe his houre,<br />
And be the first should come vnto the bowre:<br />
For <i>Pyramus</i> had sworne there for to meete her,<br />
And like to <i>Venus</i> champion there to greet her.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">13</span><br />
<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> and he, for both did sit on bryers,<br />
Till they enioyd the height of their desires:<br />
Sought out all meanes they could to keep their vow,<br />
And steale away, and yet they knew not how.<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> at last (yet of the two the first)<br />
Got out, she went to coole loues burning thirst,<br />
Yet ere she went (yet as she went) she hide,<br />
She had a care to decke her vp in pride,<br />
Respecting more his loue to whom she went,<br />
Then parents feare, though knowing to be shent,<br />
And trickt her selfe so like a willing louer,<br />
As purblind <i>Cupid</i> tooke her for his mother.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">14</span><br />
<br />
Her vpper garment was a robe of lawne,<br />
On which bright <i>Venus</i> siluer doues were drawne:<br />
The like wore <i>Venus</i>, <i>Venus</i> robe was white,<br />
And so was <i>Thisbes</i> not so faire to sight,<br />
Nor yet so fine, yet was it full as good,<br />
Because it was not stain'd with true loues bloud.<br />
About her waste, she wore a scarfe of blew,<br />
In which by cunning needle-worke she drew<br />
Loue-wounded <i>Venus</i> in the bushie groue,<br />
VVhere she inheated, <i>Adon</i> scornd her loue.<br />
This scarfe she wore, (<i>Venus</i> wore such another)<br />
And that made <i>Cupid</i> take her for his mother.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">15</span><br />
<br />
Nymph-like attyr'd (for so she was attyr'd)<br />
She went to purchase what true loue desyr'd,<br />
And as she trode vpon the tender grasse,<br />
The grasse did kisse her feet as she did passe:<br />
And when her feet against a floure did strike,<br />
The bending floures did stoope to doe the like:<br />
And when her feet did from the ground arise,<br />
The ground she trod on, kist her heele likewise.<br />
Tread where she would, faire <i>Thisbe</i> could not misse,<br />
For euery grasse would rob her of a kisse.<br />
And more the boughs wold bend, for ioy to meet her<br />
And chanting birds, with madrigals would greet her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">16</span><br />
<br />
Thus goes this maidlike Nimph, or Nimphlike maid,<br />
Vnto the place afore appointed laid,<br />
And as she past the groues and fountaines cleere,<br />
Where Nymphs vsd hunting, for Nymphs hunted there,<br />
They sware she was <i>Diana</i>, or more bright.<br />
For through the leauie boughs they tooke delight,<br />
To view her daintie footing as she tript:<br />
And once they smil'd, for once faire <i>Thisbe</i> slipt,<br />
Yet though she slipt, she had so swift a pace,<br />
As that her slipping wrought her no disgrace.<br />
For of the Nymphs (whose coy eyes did attend her)<br />
Of all was none, of all that could amend her.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">17</span><br />
<br />
VVhen she had past <i>Dianes</i> curious traine,<br />
The crooked way did bending turne againe,<br />
Vpon the left hand by a forrest side,<br />
Where (out alas) a woe chance did betide:<br />
For loue-adoring <i>Thisbe</i> was so faire,<br />
That bruitish beasts at her delighted are:<br />
And from the rest as many beasts did rome,<br />
A lamb deuouring Lion forth did come,<br />
And hauing lately torne a sillie Lambe,<br />
The full gorg'd Lion sported as it came,<br />
To him a sport, his sport made <i>Thisbe</i> hie her,<br />
For why, she durst not let the beast come nie her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">18</span><br />
<br />
Yet still it came, to welcome her it came,<br />
And not to hurt, yet fearefull is the name,<br />
The name more then the Lion, her dismayd,<br />
For in her lap the Lion would haue playd.<br />
Nor meant the beast to spill her guilelesse bloud,<br />
Yet doubtfull <i>Thisbe</i> in a fearefull moode,<br />
Let fall her mantle, made of purest white,<br />
And tender heart, betooke her straight to flight,<br />
And neere the place where she should meet her loue,<br />
Shee slipt, but quickely slipt into a groue,<br />
And lo a friendly Caue did entertaine her,<br />
For feare the bloudy Lion should haue slaine her.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">19</span><br />
<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> thus scap't, for thus she scap't his force,<br />
Although (God wot) it fell out farther worse:<br />
The Lion came yet meant no harme at all,<br />
And comming found the mantle she let fall,<br />
Which now he kist, he would haue kist her too,<br />
But that her nimble footmanship said no.<br />
He found the robe, which quickly he might find,<br />
For being light, it houered in the winde:<br />
VVith which the game-some Lion long did play,<br />
Till hunger cald him thence to seeke his prey:<br />
And hauing playd, for play was all his pleasure,<br />
He left the mantle, <i>Thisbes</i> chiefest treasure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">20</span><br />
<br />
Yet ere he left it, being in a mood,<br />
He tore it much, and stain'd it ore with bloud,<br />
Which done, with rage he hasted to his prey,<br />
For they in murther passe their time away.<br />
And now time-telling, <i>Pyramus</i> at last,<br />
(For yet the houre of meeting was not past)<br />
Got forth (he would haue got away before)<br />
But fate and fortune sought to wrong him more:<br />
For euen that day, more fatall then the rest,<br />
He needs must giue attendance at a feast,<br />
Ere which was done (swift time was shrewdly wasted)<br />
But being done, the louely stripling hasted.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">21</span><br />
<br />
In hast he ran, but ran in vaine God wot,<br />
<i>Thisbe</i> he sought, faire <i>Thisbe</i> found he not,<br />
And yet at last her long loue robe he found<br />
All rent and torne vpon the bloody ground.<br />
At which suspicion told him she was dead,<br />
And onely that remained in her stead:<br />
Which made him weepe, like mothers, so wept he,<br />
That with their eyes their murthered children see;<br />
And gathering vp the limbes in peecemeale torne,<br />
Of their deare burthen murtherously forlorne:<br />
So <i>Pyramus</i> sicke thoughted like a mother,<br />
For <i>Thisbes</i> losse, more deare then any other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">22</span><br />
<br />
Or who hath seene a mournefull Doe lament<br />
For her young Kid, in peecemeale torne and rent,<br />
And by the poore remainders sit and mourne,<br />
For loue of that which (out alas) is gone?<br />
Let him behold sad <i>Pyramus</i>, and say,<br />
Her losse, his loue, doth equall euery way.<br />
For as a man that late hath lost his wits,<br />
Breakes into fury and disaster fits,<br />
So <i>Pyramus</i> in griefe without compare,<br />
Doth rend his flesh, and teare his golden haire,<br />
Making the trees to tremble at his mourning,<br />
And speechlesse beasts to sorrow with his groaning.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">23</span><br />
<br />
Alas (quoth he) and then he tore his flesh,<br />
Gone is the sunne that did my Zone refresh,<br />
Gone is the life, by which I wretch did liue,<br />
Gone is my heauen, which hopefull blisse did giue,<br />
To giue me heat, her selfe lyes nak't and cold,<br />
To giue me life, to death her selfe she sold,<br />
To giue me ioy, she bale alas did gaine,<br />
My heat, life, ioy, procur'd her death, bale, paine:<br />
Had I beene here, my loue had not beene dead,<br />
At least the beasts had torne me in her stead,<br />
Or would they yet teare me for company,<br />
Their loue to me would slacke their tyranny.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">24</span><br />
<br />
And then he cast his eyes vpon the ground,<br />
And here and there where bloudie grasse he found;<br />
Sweet bloud (quoth he) and then he kist the bloud,<br />
And yet that kisse God wot did little good,<br />
Couldst thou being powr'd into my halfe slaine brest,<br />
Reuiue againe, or purchase <i>Thisbes</i> rest,<br />
This hand should teare a passage through the same,<br />
And yet that bloud from <i>Thisbe</i> neuer came,<br />
And then be gatherd vp the bloudie grasse,<br />
And looking grieu'd, and grieuing cryde alas,<br />
Where shall I hide this bloud of my deare louer,<br />
That neither man nor beast may it discouer?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">25</span><br />
<br />
Then in the mantle he the grasse vp tide,<br />
And laid it close vnto his naked side:<br />
Lie there (quoth he) deare to me as my hart,<br />
Of which thy mistresse had the greater part.<br />
Tut she is dead, and then he vow'd and swore,<br />
He would not liue to murther loue no more:<br />
Which spoke, he drew his Rapier from his side,<br />
Of which the loue-slaine youth would then haue dy'd,<br />
But that he thought, that pennance too too small,<br />
To pacifie faire <i>Thisbes</i> Ghost withall:<br />
Wherefore he rag'd, and ragingly exclaimed,<br />
That he true loue, and true loue him had maimed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">26</span><br />
<br />
And then his Rapier vp againe he tooke,<br />
Then on the mantle cast a grieuous looke.<br />
For me (quoth he) faire <i>Thisbe</i> lost this bloud,<br />
She dead, my life would doe me little good,<br />
And well he thought he could endure the smart<br />
Of death, and yet he could not harme his heart:<br />
For why his hand being guiltlesse of the deed,<br />
Deny'd to make his harmelesse heart to bleed,<br />
And like a trembling executioner,<br />
Constrain'd to slay a guiltelesse prisoner,<br />
His hand retired still, further backe and further,<br />
As lothing to enact so vile a murther.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">27</span><br />
<br />
But <i>Pyramus</i> like to a raging Iudge,<br />
Seeing his executioner flinch, and grudge<br />
To do the duty he enioyn'd him do,<br />
Reply'd, dispatch, or Ile cut thee off too:<br />
At which the trembling hand tooke vp the blade,<br />
But when the second profer it had made,<br />
It threw it downe, and boldly thus replyed,<br />
He was not cause that louely <i>Thisbe</i> dyed,<br />
Nor would I slay thee, knew I she were dead:<br />
Then be the bloud vpon thy guiltie head.<br />
Of these last words young <i>Pyramus</i> dispences,<br />
And cald a synodie of all his seuer'd sences.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">28</span><br />
<br />
His conscience told him, he deserv'd not death,<br />
For he deprav'd not <i>Thisbe</i> of her breath:<br />
But then suspicion thought, he causd her dye,<br />
But conscience swore, suspition told a lye.<br />
At this suspicion prompted loue in th'eare,<br />
And bad him shew his verdict, and come neare,<br />
Which soone he did, and fate among the rest,<br />
As one whom <i>Pyramus</i> esteemed best:<br />
For when proud Loue gaue in his faultie plea,<br />
He askt if he were guiltie, Loue said yea,<br />
And with the youth, fond youth by loue entangled,<br />
Agreed his guiltlesse body should be mangled.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">29</span><br />
<br />
Resolv'd to die, he sought the pointed blade,<br />
Which erst his hand had cast into the shade,<br />
And see, proud Chance, fell Murthers chiefest frend,<br />
Had pitcht the blade right vpwards on the end,<br />
Which being loth from murther to depart,<br />
Stood on the hilt, point-blanke against his hart:<br />
At which he smil'd, and checkt his fearefull hand,<br />
That stubbornely resisted his command.<br />
And though (quoth he) thou scorn'd to doe my will,<br />
What lets me now my minde for to fulfill?<br />
Both Fate and Fortune to my death are willing,<br />
And be thou witnesse of my minds fulfilling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">30</span><br />
<br />
With that he cast himselfe vpon the sword,<br />
And with the fall his tender brest through gor'd:<br />
The angry bloud, for so his bloud was sheed,<br />
Gusht out, to finde the author of the deed,<br />
But when it none but <i>Pyramus</i> had found,<br />
Key cold with feare it stood vpon the ground,<br />
And all the bloud, I meane that thus was spilt,<br />
Ran downe the blade, and circled in the hilt,<br />
And presently congeald about the same,<br />
And would haue cald it by some murtherous name,<br />
Could it haue spoke, nere sought it any further,<br />
But did arrest the Rapier of the murther.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">31</span><br />
<br />
And as the child that seeth his father slaine,<br />
Will runne (alas) although he runne in vaine,<br />
And hug about the shedder of his bloud,<br />
Although God wot, his hugging do small good,<br />
Euen so his bloud, the ofspring of his heart,<br />
Ran out amaine, to take his fathers part,<br />
And hung vpon the rapier and the hilt,<br />
As who should say, the sword his bloud had spilt:<br />
Nor would depart, but cleaue about the same,<br />
So deare it lov'd the place from whence it came:<br />
For sure it was poore <i>Pyramus</i> was murthered,<br />
Nor by pursute, could his poore bloud be furthred.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">32</span><br />
<br />
When this was done, as thus the deed was done,<br />
Begun, alas, and ended too too soone,<br />
Faire <i>Thisbe</i> strucken pale with cold despaire,<br />
Came forth the Caue into the wholsome aire:<br />
And as she came, the boughs would giue her way,<br />
Thinking her <i>Venus</i> in her best array.<br />
But she (alas) full of suspicious feare,<br />
Least that the late feard Lion should be there,<br />
Came quaking forth, and then start backe againe,<br />
Fearing the beast, and yet she fear'd in vaine.<br />
She fear'd the Lion, Lions then were feeding,<br />
And in this feare, her nose gusht out a bleeding.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">33</span><br />
<br />
Her sudden bleeding argued some mischance,<br />
Which cast her doubtfull senses in a trance,<br />
But of the Lion troubled <i>Thisbe</i> thought,<br />
And then of him, whom fearefully she sought:<br />
Yet forth she went, replete with iealous feare,<br />
Still fearing, of the Lion was her feare:<br />
And if a bird but flew from forth a bush,<br />
She straightwaies thought, she heard the Lion rush.<br />
Her nose left bleeding, that amaz'd her more<br />
Then all the troublous feare she felt before:<br />
For sudden bleeding argues ill ensuing,<br />
But sudden leauing, is fell feares renewing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">34</span><br />
<br />
By this she came into the open wood,<br />
Where <i>Pyramus</i> had lost his dearest bloud,<br />
And round about she rolles her sun bright eyes<br />
For <i>Pyramus</i>, whom no where she espies;<br />
Then forth she tript, and nearly too she tript,<br />
And ouer hedges oft this virgin skipt.<br />
Then did she crosse the fields, and new mown grasse,<br />
To find the place whereas this arbour was:<br />
For it was seated in a pleasant shade,<br />
And by the shepheards first this bowre was made.<br />
Faire <i>Thisbe</i> made more haste into the bower,<br />
Because that now was iust the meeting hower.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">35</span><br />
<br />
But comming thither, as she soone was there,<br />
She found him not, which did augment her feare:<br />
But straight she thought (as true loue thinks the best)<br />
He had beene laid downe in the shade to rest,<br />
Or of set purpose hidden in the reeds,<br />
To make her seeke him in the sedgie weeds,<br />
For so of children they had done before,<br />
Which made her thoughts seeme true so much the more:<br />
But hauing sought whereas she thought he was,<br />
Shee could not finde her <i>Pyramus</i> (alas)<br />
Wherefore she back return'd vnto the arbor,<br />
And there reposd her after all her labor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">36</span><br />
<br />
To one that's weary drowsie sleepe will creepe,<br />
Weary was <i>Thisbe</i>, <i>Thisbe</i> fell asleepe,<br />
And in her sleepe she dreamt she did lament,<br />
Thinking her heart from forth her brest was rent,<br />
By her owne censure damn'd to cruell death,<br />
And in her sight bereft of vitall breath.<br />
When she awak't, as long she had not slept,<br />
She wept amaine, yet knew not why she wept:<br />
For as before her heart was whole and sound,<br />
And no defect about her could be found,<br />
She dreamt she hurt, no hurt could she discouer,<br />
Wherefore she went to seeke her late lost louer.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">37</span><br />
<br />
Suspicious eyes, quick messengers of wo,<br />
Brought home sad newes ere <i>Thisbe</i> farre could go:<br />
For lo, vpon the margent of the wood,<br />
They spy'd her loue, lye weltring in his bloud,<br />
Hauing her late lost mantle at his side,<br />
Stained with bloud, his hart bloud was not dry'd.<br />
VVisty she lookt, and as she lookt did cry,<br />
See, see, my hart, which I did iudge to dye:<br />
Poore hart (quoth she) and then she kist his brest,<br />
VVert thou inclosd in mine, there shouldst thou rest:<br />
I causd thee die poore heart, yet rue thy dying,<br />
And saw thy death, as I asleepe was lying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">38</span><br />
<br />
Thou art my hart, more deare then is mine owne,<br />
And thee sad death in my false sleepe was showne:<br />
And then she pluckt away the murtherous blade,<br />
And curst the hands by whom it first was made,<br />
And yet she kist his hand that held the same,<br />
And double kist the wound from whence it came.<br />
Him selfe was author of his death she knew,<br />
For yet the wound was fresh, and bleeding new,<br />
And some bloud yet the ill-made wound did keepe,<br />
VVhich when she saw, she freshly gan to weepe,<br />
And wash the wound with fresh tears down distilling,<br />
And view'd the same (God wot) with eyes vnwilling.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">39</span><br />
<br />
She would haue spoke, but griefe stopt vp her breath,<br />
For me (quoth she) my Loue is done to death,<br />
And shall I liue, sighes stopt her hindmost word,<br />
When speechlesse vp she tooke the bloudy sword,<br />
And then she cast a looke vpon her Loue,<br />
Then to the blade her eye she did remoue.<br />
And sobbing cride, since loue hath murthred thee,<br />
He shall not chuse but likewise murther me:<br />
That men may say, and then she sigh'd againe,<br />
I him, he me, loue him and me hath slaine.<br />
Then with resolue, loue her resolue did further:<br />
With that same blade, her selfe, her selfe did murther.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">40</span><br />
<br />
Then with a sigh, she fell vpon the blade,<br />
And from the bleeding wound the sword had made,<br />
Her fearefull bloud ran trickling to the ground,<br />
And sought about, till <i>Pyramus</i> it found:<br />
And hauing found him, circled in his corse,<br />
As who should say, Ilegard thee by my force.<br />
And when it found his bloud, as forth it came,<br />
Then would it stay, and touch, and kisse the same,<br />
As who should say, my mistresse loue to thee,<br />
Though dead in her, doth still remaine in me,<br />
And for a signe of mutuall loue in either,<br />
Their ill shed bloud congealed both together.</div>

<big>I</big><span class="smcap">n</span> <i>Catheloygne</i>, o'repeerd by <i>Pyren</i> Mountaines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(a Prouince seated in the East of Spaine,</span><br />
Famous for hunting sports &amp; cleerest fountains)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">a young heroyck gallant did remaine;</span><br />
Hee, Signior <i>Dom Diego</i> had to name,<br />
Who for his constant faith had got such fame.<br />
<br />
Nature had tryde her deepest skill on him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(for so the heauen-borne powers had her desired)</span><br />
With such perfection framed shee each lim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that at her owne worke shee herselfe admired.</span><br />
Maiestick <i>Ioue</i> gaue him a Princely grace,<br />
<i>Apollo</i> wit, and <i>Venus</i> gaue his face.<br />
<br />
This loue-some youth, kinde Natures fairest child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">what for his beautious loue-alluring face,</span><br />
And for he was so gracious and so milde;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">was deem'd of all to be of heauenly race;</span><br />
Men honord him, and Maydens gaue him loue,<br />
To make him famous Men and Maydens stroue.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><br />
Hunting he lou'd, nor did he scorne to loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(a truer-louing hart was neuer knowne)</span><br />
Which well his Mistres cruelly did proue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose causelesse rigor Fame abroad hath blowne.</span><br />
But now lets tell, how hee on hunting went,<br />
And in what sports such pleasant time he spent.<br />
<br />
Soone as the sunne had left his watry bed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(blushing for shame that he so long had slept)</span><br />
Reuiuing those which duskie Night made dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when for his welcom Lambes on mountains lept.</span><br />
Vp starts <i>Diego</i>, and with shrill-voyc'd horne.<br />
Tells hounds &amp; huntsmen of a cleere-fac'd morne.<br />
<br />
Cloth'd all in Greene, (<i>Syluanus</i> lyuery)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">he wore a low-crown'd hat of finest silke,</span><br />
Whose brim turnd vp, was fastned with a Ruby,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and vnderneath, a Pearle as white as milke,</span><br />
A sleeueles coate of Damaske, richly laced<br />
With Indian pearle, as thicke as could be placed.<br />
<br />
A glistring Cutlax pendent by his side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(he much esteem'd y<sup>t</sup> beast-dismembring blade)</span><br />
And halfe-leg'd Buskins curiously ytide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with loopes of burnisht gold full finely made,</span><br />
Thus goes <i>Diego</i>, chiefest of his name,<br />
With siluer-headed speare to finde some game.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br />
Long while it was ere any sport began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">at last a Hart his big-growne hornes did shew,</span><br />
VVhich (winding straight the huntsmen) gan to run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as fast as arrow from a Parthyan bow:</span><br />
In whose pursute (by wil of powreful Fates)<br />
<i>Diego</i> lost himfelfe, and all his mates.<br />
<br />
Left thus alone in midst of vnknowne place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">he inuocates the fauourable ayde</span><br />
Of <i>Ariadne</i>, who with smalest lace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">freed Monster-killing <i>Theseus</i>, so dismaid,</span><br />
In worser Laborinth did he now remaine,<br />
For none saue trees or beasts, could heare him plain.<br />
<br />
In these Meanders, stragling heere and there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">goes faire <i>Diego</i>, listning to each sound,</span><br />
Musing twixt purple hope, and palish feare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">he thought to rest him (wearied) on the ground,</span><br />
But see, he heares a farre some forced noyse,<br />
A horne, a hound, or els some human voyce.<br />
<br />
VVith that, Desire, which scornes least tedious let,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">directed him vnto that very place,</span><br />
Where loe to hunt the tymerous Hare, were met<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as Knights, so Ladies, fittest for that chase:</span><br />
Mongst which, there came a Grace of heau&#275;ly faire,<br />
Her name <i>Gyneura</i>, with the golden hayre.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><br />
Her hayre of such corruscant glitterous shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as are the smallest streames of hottest sunne,</span><br />
Like starres in frostie night, so looke her eyne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">within whose Arches Christall springs doe run,</span><br />
Her cheekes faire show of purest Porphyrie,<br />
Full curiously were typt with roseall die.<br />
<br />
Her lips like ripened Cherries seem'd to be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">from out whose concaue Corrall-seeming Fount,</span><br />
Came sweeter breath then muske of Araby,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose teeth y<sup>e</sup> white of blanched pearle surmount</span><br />
Her necke the Lillies of <i>Lyguria</i><br />
Did much exceed; Thus looked fayre <i>Gyneura</i>.<br />
<br />
These Dryades <i>Diego</i> then bespake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with sugred tearmes of mildest curtesie,</span><br />
And crau'd to know which way he best might take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with shortest cut, to such a Signiory,</span><br />
Whereat he nam'd himselfe; when presently<br />
The Ladies knew him (as a Neyghbour by.)<br />
<br />
<i>Gyneuras</i> Mother (cheefe of all the rest)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(for that shee knew his birth and his discent)</span><br />
Desir'd him home, he grants her such request,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and thanks the Fates that him such hap had lent,</span><br />
For still on faire <i>Gyneura</i> were his eyes,<br />
And shee reciprocally on his replyes.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><br />
These dumbe Embassadors, Loues chiefe combatants<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">tell (softly whispring in each others hart)</span><br />
Her of humble seruice; him of acceptance;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his craued loue, hers wisht they nere might part,</span><br />
Much talk they had w<sup>t</sup> tongues, more w<sup>t</sup> their eyes,<br />
But (oh) most with their harts, where true loue lies.<br />
<br />
Now were they come whereas the good old Lady<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">might boldly welcome her inuited guest,</span><br />
Where after little talke, (Hunters are hungry)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">they all sat downe vnto a soone-made feast,</span><br />
The Louers fed on glaunces of their eyes,<br />
Tis heauenly food when both do simpathize.<br />
<br />
At last, the Lady of the house espied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the intercourse of those bright Messengers,</span><br />
Who inwardly reioycing, as fast plied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hers on her daughter, fittest Harbengers,</span><br />
To bid her keepe the fairest and the best<br />
Place in her hart, to entertaine this guest.<br />
<br />
Word back againe was sent by her faire light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">how that was done already; and replied,</span><br />
The Land-lord o're his Tennant hath such might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that he to enter in is nere denied.</span><br />
I, in a little corner of my hart<br />
Doe liue, (quoth she) he hath the greatest part.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><br />
<i>Diego</i> wisht thys supper nere would end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(and yet he long'd to be in priuate place,</span><br />
To ruminate vpon his fairest friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and to recount the beauties of her face)</span><br />
So wisht <i>Gyneura</i>, were neuer such two,<br />
That lou'd so deerely as these Louers doe.<br />
<br />
The gloomy Curtaines of the tongue-lesse night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">were drawne so close as day could not be seene,</span><br />
Now leaden-thoughted <i>Morpheus</i> dyms each sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">now, murder, rapes, and robberies begin:</span><br />
Nature crau'd rest, but restlesse Loue would none,<br />
<i>Diego</i>, Loues young prentice, thus gan mone.<br />
<br />
Oh heauens, what new-founde griefes possesse my mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">what rare impassionated fits be these?</span><br />
Cold-burning Feuers in my hart I find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose opposite effects worke mee no ease,</span><br />
Then loue assailes the hart with hotest fight,<br />
VVhen beauty makes her conqust at first sight.<br />
<br />
I little dreamed of thys strange euent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(this harts-inthraller, mindes-disturbing Loue,</span><br />
VVhen with my Huntsmen to the woods I went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh neere till now did I his greatnes proue,</span><br />
Whose first impression in the Louers hart,<br />
Till then nere tainted, bringeth deepest smart.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><br />
Thus lay <i>Diego</i> tossing in his bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">bound to the will of all commaunding beauty,</span><br />
Whom angry <i>Cupid</i> now in tryumph led,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">expecting from his slaue all seruile duty,</span><br />
Hee might haue freed his prysoner so dismaid,<br />
For sighes and grones had double ransome paide.<br />
<br />
In like extreames, (Loue loues extremity)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">did faire <i>Gyneura</i> passe the long-thought night,</span><br />
Shee raild against fell <i>Cupids</i> crueltie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that so would tyrannize o're a Maydens spright.</span><br />
There needes no blowes, quoth she, when foes doe yield,<br />
Oh cease, take thou the honor of the field.<br />
<br />
The valiant Greekes (faire Ilyons fatall Foes)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">their tedious ten yeres siedge for Spartaes Queen</span><br />
Nere thought so long; (yet long it was) as those<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">loue-scorcht enamored (so restles) now ween</span><br />
This night to be; A night if spent in care,<br />
Seemes longer then a thousand pleasant are.<br />
<br />
Thus lay they sleeplesse, thoughtfull, euer thinking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">on sluggish humor of expected Morne,</span><br />
They thought that Louers eyes were neuer winking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">nor sleepe they e're in whom Loues newly borne.</span><br />
Hee vow'd, when day was come, to woo his deere,<br />
Shee swore such wooing she would gladly heare.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><br />
At last, the guyder of the firie Coach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">drying his locks wet in <i>Eurotas</i> floud,</span><br />
Gan resalute the world with bright approch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">angry he seem'd, for all his face was bloud:</span><br />
<i>Auroraes</i> hast had made him looke so red,<br />
For loath he was to leaue faire <i>Thetis</i> bed.<br />
<br />
Scarce were his horses put in readines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and he himselfe full mounted on his seate,</span><br />
VVhen <i>Dom Diego</i> full of heauines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">abroade did walke, his night talke to repeate</span><br />
Some two howres spent, he in againe retires,<br />
And sees his Mistres, whom he now admires.<br />
<br />
Whereat inflam'd, (loue brookes no base delay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose fruite is danger, whose reward is paine)</span><br />
With fine-fil'd termes he giues her the good day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and blushing, she returnes it him againe.</span><br />
<i>Endimeons</i> blush her beauty did eclypse,<br />
His causd by <i>Cynthiaes</i>, hers <i>Adonis</i> lyps.<br />
<br />
Boldly encourag'd by her milde aspect,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">he told her that which Louers vse to tell,</span><br />
How he did liue by her faire eyes reflect,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and how his hart in midst of hers did dwell.</span><br />
Much eloquence he vsd, twas needles done,<br />
To win that hart which was already won.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><br />
Ne're did the dungeon thiefe condemn'd to dye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with greater pleasure heare his pardon read,</span><br />
Then did <i>Gyneura</i> heare his Oratorie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(of force sufficient to reuiue the dead)</span><br />
Shee needes must yield; for sure he had the Art,<br />
VVith amorous heate to fixe <i>Dianaes</i> hart.<br />
<br />
These Louers (thus in this both-pleasing parly)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">were interrupted by <i>Geneuraes</i> Mother</span><br />
VVho newly vp, (age seldome ryseth early)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">gan straight salute her guest, so did he her,</span><br />
Some termes of kindnes mutually past,<br />
Shee friendly leades him in, to breake his fast.<br />
<br />
VVhich done, (as all good manners did require)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee thankt his Hostis for her curtesie,</span><br />
And now at length went home for to retire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">where hee was looked for so earnestly,</span><br />
The Lady crau'd if ere hee came that way,<br />
To see her house, and there to make some stay.<br />
<br />
Then heauily, and with a dying eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(ioylesse) hee takes his leaue of his faire Loue,</span><br />
VVho for to fauour him, full graciously,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with louing count'nance gaue to him her Gloue.</span><br />
Keepe this (quoth shee) till better fortune fall,<br />
My Gloue, my Loue, my hand, my hart, and all.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><br />
At this large offer, bashfull modestie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with pure Vermilion stain'd her all faire face,</span><br />
So lookt <i>Calystone</i> at her great bellie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when chast <i>Ilythia</i> spi'd her in such case;</span><br />
Let Louers iudge how grieuous tis to part,<br />
From two, twixt whom, there lyueth but one hart.<br />
<br />
Nowe is hee gone, who after little travell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">attain'd his house (not pleasing thought desired)</span><br />
At whose late absence each one much did maruell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but (come) at his sad lookes they more admired,</span><br />
Great <i>Cupids</i> power, such sadnes in him bred,<br />
VVho (erst) all louing harts in tryumph led.<br />
<br />
One month (consum'd in pensiuenes) expir'd;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to recreate and reuiue his tyred spright,</span><br />
Hee now on hunting goes, which hee desir'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">not for the (once well-pleasing) sports delight;</span><br />
But for he might some fit occasion finde,<br />
To see his Loue, on whom was all his minde.<br />
<br />
Where being come (suppose his sports prou'd bad)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gyneura</i> gaue him welcome from her hart,</span><br />
The Sea-tost Lord of <i>Ithica</i> ne're had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">after his twentie yeares turmoile and smart,</span><br />
More ioyfull welcome by his constant wife<br />
Then had <i>Diego</i> from his loue, his lyfe.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><br />
Two dayes he stay'd, whence he would ne're depart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but custome wil'd that he should now returne,</span><br />
Yet though he went he left with her his hart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which for their parting heauily gan mourne,</span><br />
But for worse newes had it poore hart to greeue,<br />
In that <i>Gyneura</i> would so soone beleeue.<br />
<br />
For sooner was hee not departed thence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but straight there comes a Riuall of his Loue,</span><br />
VVho vnder true fidellities pretence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wrought wondrous hard <i>Diego</i> to remoue,</span><br />
Nor could at first his oaths or vowes preuaile,<br />
To make <i>Gyneuraes</i> loue one whit to faile.<br />
<br />
For yet they lyu'd fast bound in Fancies chaines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">stryuing to passe each other in pure loue,</span><br />
But (as there's nothing that for aye remaines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">without some change.) so do these Louers proue,</span><br />
That hottest loue hath soon'st the cold'st disdaine,<br />
And greatest pleasures, haue their greatest paine.<br />
<br />
For now no longer could shee so perseuer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">shee turnes to deadly hate her former kindnes,</span><br />
Which still had lasted; but that Nature euer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">strikes into womens eyes such dim-sight blindnes,</span><br />
And such obdurate hardnes in their harts,<br />
They see, nor knowe, not truest loues desarts.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><br />
<i>Gyneura</i> this confirmes against her Louer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whom now (all guiltlesse) she condemnes to die,</span><br />
That in his deede or thought did nere offend her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vnlesse by louing her so wondrous deerelie.</span><br />
Such Loue, such hate, such lyking, such disdains,<br />
Was neuer knowne in one hart to remaine.<br />
<br />
Thus twas; <i>Diego</i> had an enemie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(immortall vertue euer lincked is,</span><br />
With that pale leane-fac'd meager-hewed enuie)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who secretly (so falsely) tells his Mis.</span><br />
How shee was mockt; <i>Diego</i> lou'd another,<br />
And storm'd &amp; rag'd what madnes so should moue her.<br />
<br />
To dote on him that else where sets his Loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee makes you thinke (quoth he) what ere he list,</span><br />
That this is true, you easily may proue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">for still he weares her fauour on his fist,</span><br />
A Hawke it is; which shee (so stands the Mart)<br />
Giues him, he you faire words, but her his hart.<br />
<br />
VVith this incenst, (that sex will soone beleeue)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">soonest when enuies broode to them display it,</span><br />
I'st true (quoth shee) for true loue doth he giue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">such smooth-fac'd flattry, doth he thus repay it?</span><br />
Shee neuer scan'd, the truth of this her griefe,<br />
Loue in such cases, is of quicke beliefe.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><br />
Her loue to him was neuer halfe so great,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(though once shee lou'd him) as is now her hate,</span><br />
This <i>Momus</i> breath (like bellowes) to her heate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">did kindle firie coales of hote debate.</span><br />
Hee plyes her; and exasperates his spight,<br />
And sweares, and vowes, hee tells her but the right.<br />
<br />
Shee (like a franticke Froe of <i>Thessaly</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">madded with <i>Bacchus</i> brayne-distempring liquor)</span><br />
Runs here, and there, exclayming furiously<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with hideous, vncouth mind-affrighting terror.</span><br />
Swearing reuenge on false <i>Diegoes</i> head,<br />
VVhose lying lookes in her such madnes bred.<br />
<br />
VVherewith shee inuocates great <i>Nemesis</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and begs the power of her deitie,</span><br />
Shee tells her case, to Iustice-doing <i>Themis</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and shewes how shee is wronged mightily.</span><br />
Shee leaues no power vnsought for, or vnpraide,<br />
That vse to helpe distressed with their aide.<br />
<br />
VVronged <i>Diego</i> (little this suspecting)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">now thought it time to see his deerest faire,</span><br />
And (other matters of import neglecting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee presently to her makes his repaire.</span><br />
VVhere being come, such welcome he did finde,<br />
As at the first did much disturbe his minde.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><br />
For faire <i>Gyneura</i> would not now be seene,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">she sent him word she scorn'd his fauning flattrie,</span><br />
And much did greeue that shee so fond had beene,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to yield her hart to such deceitfull battrie:</span><br />
Bid him (quoth shee) goe flatter where he list,<br />
I like not I, that fauour on his fist.<br />
<br />
Such hap it was, <i>Diego</i> then had brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his Hawke; (the author of this fell debate)</span><br />
Which well confirm'd her euer doubtfull thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that nowe shee was resolu'd on deadly hate,</span><br />
Bid him (quoth she) depart hence from my sight,<br />
His loath-some presence brings me irksome spight.<br />
<br />
Twas hard; that he whose loue was neuer tainted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose sincere faith was kept inuiolate,</span><br />
Nay, in whose face all truest loue was painted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">should for his spotlesse truth be paid with hate,</span><br />
Hee stone-astonied, like a Deare at gaze,<br />
Admir'd these speeches in a wondrous maze.<br />
<br />
At last hee crau'd this fauour he might haue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that shee her selfe would heare what he could say,</span><br />
So <i>Neptunes</i> Towne (quoth shee) such lycense gaue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to smooth-fac'd <i>Synon</i> (<i>Ilions</i> lost decay)</span><br />
So <i>Syrens</i> sing vntill they haue their will,<br />
Some poore mistrustlesse Passenger to kill.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><br />
Shee would not heare him speake (oh cruell shee)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that causelesse this would kill him with disdaine,</span><br />
Hee sweares he's guiltlesse, vowes innocencie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; in such vowes, tears down his cheeks did raine,</span><br />
Those cheeks which staine the blushing of y<sup>e</sup> morne<br />
<i>Gyneura</i> now most hatefully doth scorne.<br />
<br />
Tis strange that Maides should ere be so abused,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to credit each malicious-tongued slaue,</span><br />
And to condemne a man (if once accused)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">before or proofe, or tryall, hee may haue.</span><br />
Too many such there be; wo's mee therefore,<br />
Such light credulitie, I must deplore.<br />
<br />
When sighes, salt tears, &amp; vowes could do no good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">nor sighes, nor teares, nor vowes could pierce her hart,</span><br />
In which, disdaine triumphant victor stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">holding in eyther hand a sable dart,</span><br />
VVherewith he strikes true loue, &amp; stainlesse truth,<br />
Condemning them vnto eternall ruth.<br />
<br />
Home goes <i>Diego</i> with a cheereless face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose steps were led by leaden-footed griefe,</span><br />
VVho neuer goes but with a dead-slowe pace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vntill hee finde some ease, or some reliefe;</span><br />
Twould melt a marble hart to see that man,<br />
(Earst, fresh as a new-blowne Rose) so ashie wan.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><br />
VVhere being come, he straight for four daies space,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">locks him in his chamber, and there did poure</span><br />
Huge shewers of christall rayne adowne his face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(for sure he lou'd her deerely at this howre)</span><br />
All ouerwhelm'd in waues of sea-salt teares,<br />
Some fatall shipwrack of his life he feares.<br />
<br />
Wherewith he calls for paper, pen, and ynck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and for his Hawke, which presently he kild,</span><br />
Die thou (quoth he) so shall my loue nere thinke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that for thy sake to any else I yield.</span><br />
And plucking of her head, straight way hee writes,<br />
VVho (sending it as token) thus indites.<br />
<br />
Loe heere (thou cruell faire) that gracious fauour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the Ensigne (as thou saist) of my vntruth,</span><br />
Behold in what high-priz'd esteeme I haue her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that gaue me it, the cause of all my ruth:</span><br />
Looke as this Hawke, faire Loue, so is my hart,<br />
Mangled and torne; cause thou so cruell art.<br />
<br />
I sweare to thee by all the rites of loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">by heauens faire head, by earth, &amp; black-fac'd hel,</span><br />
I nere meant other loue but thine to proue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">nor in my hart that any else should dwell;</span><br />
Let this suffize, my ioy, my deere, my chiefe,<br />
My griefes are too too long, though letter briefe.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><br />
Twas time to ende, for floods gusht out amaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">out came the springtide of his brinish teares,</span><br />
VVhich whatsoere hee writ blot out againe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">all blubred so to send it scarce hee dares:</span><br />
And yet hee did; goe thou (quoth hee) vnto her,<br />
And for thy maister, treate, sollicite, woo her.<br />
<br />
And pray thee (if thy Fortune be so good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as to be viewd by sunshine of her eyes)</span><br />
Bid her take heede in spilling guiltlesse blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">tell her there's danger in such cruelties:</span><br />
VVith this, hee gaue it to the messenger,<br />
Who (making speed) in short time brought it her.<br />
<br />
Shee, when shee heard from whom the Letter came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">returnes it backe againe, and straight replied,</span><br />
My friend (quoth she) hadst thou not told his name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">perhaps thy Letter, had not beene denied:</span><br />
VVhereat shee paus'd; but yet ile see (quoth shee)<br />
With what perswading termes, he flatters mee.<br />
<br />
Twas quickly read; (God knowes it was but short)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">griefe would not let the wryter tedious be,</span><br />
Nor would it suffer him fit words to sort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but pens it (chaos-like) confusedly.</span><br />
Yet had it passion to haue turn'd hard stones<br />
To liquid moisture, if they heard his moanes.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><br />
But cruell shee, more hard then any flint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">worse then a Tygresse of Hyrcania,</span><br />
Would not be mou'd, nor could his lines take print<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in her hard hart, so cruell was <i>Gyneura</i>.</span><br />
Shee which once lou'd him deerly, (too too well)<br />
Now hates him more then any tongue can tell.<br />
<br />
Oh Nature, chiefest Mother of vs all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">why did you giue such apt-beleeuing harts</span><br />
To women-kind, that thus poore men inthrall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and will not dulie waie true loues desarts?</span><br />
O had their harts been like vnto their face,<br />
They sure had been of some celestiall race.<br />
<br />
Shee pittiles, sends backe to <i>Dom Diego</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and sayes, his words cannot inchant her hart,</span><br />
<i>Vlisses</i>-like, shee will not heare <i>Calypso</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">nor lend her eares to such intising arte.</span><br />
Bid him (quoth she) fr&#333; henceforth cease to write,<br />
Tell him his Letters agrauate my spight.<br />
<br />
Full heauie newes it was to stainelesse loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to him that had enshrin'd her in his thought,</span><br />
And in his hart had honor'd her aboue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the world; to wh&#333; all else saue her seem'd nought.</span><br />
Nay, vnto him, whose person, wit, and faire,<br />
Might surely with the best make iust compare.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><br />
But (blinded as shee was) shee steemes him not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hate and disdaine doe neuer brooke respect,</span><br />
Shee did not knowe that beauties foulest blot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">consisted in true-louing harts neglect.</span><br />
No, she (more stubborne th&#275; the North-east wind)<br />
VVould not admit such knowledge in her mind.<br />
<br />
Let those who guiltleslie haue felt disdaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose faithfull loue hath beene repaid with hate,</span><br />
Giue rightfull iudgement of <i>Diegoes</i> paine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who bought his fauours at the highest rate.</span><br />
This newes such pleasure in his soule had bred,<br />
As hath the thiefe that heares his iudgement read.<br />
<br />
After some time, hee writes againe vnto her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee could not thinke shee would perseuer so,</span><br />
But when hee sawe her aunswere like the other<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee then surceas'd to send her any moe.</span><br />
But did resolue to seeke some vncouth place,<br />
VVhere he might (vnfound out) bewaile his case.<br />
<br />
Thinking indeede shee by his absence might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">at length intenerate her flintfull hart,</span><br />
And metamorphize her conceaued spight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">into true loue regardaunt of his smart;</span><br />
Hee seekes all meanes (poore Louer) how to gaine<br />
His rigorous Lady from such fell disdaine.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><br />
At last, hee calls to mind the Pyren Mountaines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">those far-fam'd, woody hills of wealthy Spaine,</span><br />
Which for wild Beasts, &amp; siluer visag'd Fountaines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hath got the praise of all that there remaine;</span><br />
Hether postes <i>Dom Diego</i> fraught with griefe,<br />
Hoping those woods would yield him some reliefe.<br />
<br />
VVhere, being come, all Pilgrim-like attir'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee pryes about to see if hee could finde,</span><br />
Some house-like Caue, for rest hee much desir'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his body now was wearie, as his minde.</span><br />
O Gods (quoth hee) if youth finde such distresse,<br />
VVhat hope haue I, of future happines.<br />
<br />
VVith that hee sees a Rocke made like a Cabin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">all tapistred with Natures mossie greene,</span><br />
VVrought in a frizled guise, as it had been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">made for <i>Nap&aelig;a</i>, Mountaines chiefest Queene,</span><br />
At mouth of which grew Cedars, Pines, &amp; Firs,<br />
And at the top grew Maple, Yough, and Poplers.<br />
<br />
So, heere (quoth hee) ile rest my wearied bodie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in thee (delightfull place of Natures building)</span><br />
VVill I erect a griefe-fram'd Monasterie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">where night &amp; day my prayers ile ne're cease yielding,</span><br />
To thee my deere; (no other Saint I haue)<br />
Oh lend thine eares, to him that his hart gaue.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><br />
Two dayes were spent in this so pleasant seate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(this stone-built Pallace of the King content)</span><br />
Before <i>Diego</i> tasted any meate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or once did drinke, more then his eyes had lent.</span><br />
O irresisted force of purest Loue,<br />
Whom paines, thirst, hunger, can no whit remoue.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, when as he scans her crueltie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; feeles his paines (like <i>Hydreas</i> head) increasing,</span><br />
Hee wisht the Scithian <i>Anthropophagie</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">did haunt these woods that liue by mans flesh eating;</span><br />
Or else the Thracian <i>Bessi</i>, so renound,<br />
For cruell murdring, whom in woods they found.<br />
<br />
That so the <i>Gordyon</i> knot of his paine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">indissoluble e'rewhiles he did lyue,</span><br />
Might be vntide when as his hart were slaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when he (&ocirc; restfull time) shold cease to grieue;</span><br />
But yet the Sisters kept his vitall breath,<br />
They would not let him dye so base a death.<br />
<br />
Some other times when as he waies her beautie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">her <i>Venus</i>-stayning face so wondrous faire,</span><br />
Hee then doth thinke to waile tis but his dutie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">sith caus'd by her that is without compaire,</span><br />
And in this moode vnto high <i>Ioue</i> hee prayes,<br />
And praying so, hee thus vnto him sayes.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span><br />
Great Gouernour of (wheele-resembling) Heauen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">commaund thy vnder Princes to mayntaine,</span><br />
Those heau&#275;ly parts which to my loue th'aue giuen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ocirc; let her ne're feele death, or deaths fell paine.</span><br />
And first vpon thy Sister lay thy mace,<br />
Bid her maintayne my Loues maiestick grace.<br />
<br />
Inioyne the strange-borne mother-lesse <i>Mynerua</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and her to whom the fomie Sea was Mother,</span><br />
Still to vphold their giftes in my <i>Gyneura</i>:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">let wit and beautie lyue vnited with her;</span><br />
With sweete mouth'd <i>Pytho</i> I may not suspence,<br />
Great Goddesse; still increase her eloquence.<br />
<br />
Thou musicall <i>Apollo</i> gau'st her hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and thou her feete (great Sun-Gods deerest loue)</span><br />
To such your rare-knowne gyfts all gracious stand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and now at last this doe I craue great <i>Ioue</i>,</span><br />
That when they dye (perhaps they dye aboue)<br />
Thou wilt bequeath these gyfts vnto my Loue.<br />
<br />
On euery neighbour Tree, on euery stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(hee durst not far range from his secure Caue)</span><br />
VVould he cut out the cause of all his moane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and curiouslie with greatest skill ingraue:</span><br />
There needed no <i>Leontius</i>, his Art,<br />
Griefe carueth deepest, if it come from th'hart.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><br />
VVhen some stone would not impression take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee straight compares it to his Mistris hart,</span><br />
But stay, (quoth he) my working teares shall make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thee penetrable with the least skil'd art.</span><br />
Oh had my teares such force to pierce her mind,<br />
These sorrowes I should loose, and new ioyes find.<br />
<br />
Thou euer-memorable stone (quoth hee)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">tell those whom fate or fortune heere shall lead,</span><br />
How deerely I haue lou'd the cruel'st shee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that euer Nature or the world hath bred.</span><br />
Tell them her hate, and her disdaine was causelesse,<br />
Oh, leaue not out to tell how I was guiltlesse.<br />
<br />
Whereat, the very stone would seeme to weepe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose wrinkled face wold be besmeard with tears</span><br />
O man what ere thou be, thy sorrowes keepe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vnto thy selfe, quoth hee; ile heare no cares.</span><br />
Tell them that care not, tell <i>Gyneura</i> of thee,<br />
We stones are ruthfull, &amp; thy plaints haue pierc'd mee.<br />
<br />
VVith this, hee seekes a russet-coated Tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; straight disclothes him of his long-worne weed</span><br />
And whilest hee thus disroabes him busilie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">hee felt his halfe-dead hart a fresh to bleed.</span><br />
Greeuing that hee should vse such crueltie,<br />
To turne him naked to his foe, windes furie.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><br />
But now vncas'ed, hee gins to carue his cares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his passions, his constant-lyuing Loue,</span><br />
When (loe) there gushes out cleere sap like teares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which to get forth from pryson mainly stroue,</span><br />
Since pitty dwells (quoth hee) in trees and stone,<br />
Them will I loue; <i>Gyneura</i>, thou hast none.<br />
<br />
Yet needs I must confesse thou once didst loue mee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thy loue was hotter then <i>Nimph&aelig;um</i> hill,</span><br />
But now wh&#275; time affords me, means to proue thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thy loue then <i>Caucase</i> is more cold and chill,</span><br />
And in thy cold, like Aethiopyan hue,<br />
Thou art not to be chang'd from false to true.<br />
<br />
O looke (faire Loue) as in the springing Plant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">one branch intwines and growes within another,</span><br />
So growe my griefes; which makes my hart to pant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when thicke-fetcht sighes my vitall breath doth smother,</span><br />
I spoild my cruelty am adiudg'd to death,<br />
Thus all alone to yield my lyuing breath.<br />
<br />
Thou hast the fayrest face that e're was seene,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but in thy breast (that Alablaster Rocke)</span><br />
Thou hast a fouler hart; disdaine hath beene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">accounted blacker then the Chimnies stocke.</span><br />
O purifie thy soule my dearest Loue,<br />
Dislodge thy hate, and thy disdaine remoue.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><br />
But all in vaine I speake vnto the wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">then should they carry these my plaints vnto her,</span><br />
Mee thinks thou still shouldst beare a gentle mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(deere-louing <i>Zephire</i>) pray, intreate, &amp; woo her;</span><br />
Tell her twere pittie I should dye alone,<br />
Here in these woods wher non can heare me mone.<br />
<br />
But tis no matter, shee is pittylesse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">like the Scycilian stone that more tis beate</span><br />
Doth waxe the harder; stones are not so ruthlesse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which smallest drops doe pierce though nere so great:</span><br />
If Seas of teares would weare into her hart,<br />
I had ere this beene eased of my smart.<br />
<br />
Thus in these speeches would <i>Diego</i> sit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">bathing his siluer cheekes with trickling teares,</span><br />
VVhich (often running downe) at last found fit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">channells to send them to their standing meares,</span><br />
VVho at his feete (before his feete there stood<br />
A poole of teares) receau'd the smaller flood.<br />
<br />
Ne're had the world a truer louing hart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Abydos</i> cease to speake of constant loue,</span><br />
Por sure (thou Sygnior <i>Dom Diego</i>) art<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the onely man that e're hates force did proue;</span><br />
Thy changelesse loue hath close inrol'd thy name,<br />
In steele-leau'd booke of euer-lyuing fame.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br />
That wide-mouth'd time w<sup>c</sup> swallows good desarts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">shall shut his iawes, &amp; ne're deuoure thy name,</span><br />
Thou shalt be crown'd with bayes by louing harts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and dwell in Temple of eternall Fame;</span><br />
There, is a sacred place reseru'd for thee,<br />
There, thou shalt liue with perpetuitie.<br />
<br />
So long liu'd poore <i>Diego</i> in this case<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that at the length hee waxed somwhat bold,</span><br />
To search the woods where hee might safely chase,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(necessitie, thy force cannot be told)</span><br />
The fearefull Hare, the Connie, and the Kid,<br />
Time made him knowe the places where they bid.<br />

This young-year'd Hermit, one day mong the rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as hee was busilie prouiding meate,</span><br />
VVhich was with Natures cunning almost drest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">dri'd with the Sunne new readie to be eate,</span><br />
Inrag'd vpon a suddaine throwes away<br />
His hard-got foode; and thus began to say.<br />
<br />
O cruell starres, Step-mothers of my good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; you, you ruthlesse Fates what meane you thus,</span><br />
So greedely to thirst for my harts blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">why ioy you so in vnuniting vs?</span><br />
Great powres infuse some pitty in her hart<br />
That thus hath causelesse caus'd in me this smart.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><br />
I ne're was wont to vse such Cookerie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to drudge &amp; toile wh&#275; pesants take their pleasure,</span><br />
My noble birth scornes base-borne slauerie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">this easelesse lyfe hath neither end nor measure;</span><br />
Thou great <i>Sosipolis</i> looke vpon my state,<br />
Be of these nere-hard griefes compassionate.<br />
<br />
I feele my long-thought life begin to melt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as doth the snowe gainst midday heate of Sunne,</span><br />
(Faire loue) thy rigour I haue too much felt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">oh, at the last with crueltie haue done,</span><br />
If teares thy stonie hart could mollifie,<br />
My brinish springs should floe eternallie.<br />
<br />
Sweet loue, behold those pale cheekes washt in woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that so my teares may as a mirror be,</span><br />
Thine owne faire shaddowe liuely for to shoe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and portraite forth thy Angel-hued beautie.</span><br />

More honny sweete, then <i>Venus</i> gaue <i>Adonis</i>.<br />
<br />
Feare not <i>Gyneura</i>, faire <i>Narcissus</i> hap;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thy necke, thy breast, thy hand is Lilly-white,</span><br />
They all are Lillies tane from <i>Floraes</i> lap;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">ne're be thou chang'd vnlesse to loue from spite,</span><br />
Oh that thou wer't but then transformed so,<br />
My Sommers blisse, would change my winters woe.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span><br />
If thou did'st knowe in what a loathsome place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I spend my dayes sad and disconsolate,</span><br />
VVhat foggie Stigian mists hang o re my face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thou would'st exile this thy conceaued hate;</span><br />
This Hemisphere is darke, for <i>Sol</i> him shroudes,<br />
My sighes doe so conglomerate the cloudes.<br />
<br />
I tolde thee, I, (thou cruell too seuere)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when hate first gan to rise how I was guiltlesse,</span><br />
Thine eares were deaffe, y<sup>e</sup> wouldst not harken ere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thy hart was hardned, rockie, pittilesse.</span><br />
Oh had mine eyes been blind wh&#275; first they view'd thee,<br />
Would God I had been tonglesse wh&#275; I sew'd thee.<br />
<br />
But thou wast then as readie to receaue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as I to craue; &ocirc; great inconstancie,</span><br />
O twas that fatall houre did so bereaue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">my blisfull soule of all tranquillitie:</span><br />
Thou then didst burne in loue, now froz'd in hate,<br />
Yet pittie mee, sweete mercy ne're comes late.<br />
<br />
Looke as the crazen tops of armelesse Trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or latest down-fall of some aged building,</span><br />
Doe tell thee of the North-windes boistrous furies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and how that <i>Eolus</i> lately hath beene stirring;</span><br />
So in my thin-cheekt face thou well maist see,<br />
The furious storme of thy black crueltie.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br />
But thou inexorable art, ne're to be wone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">though Lyons, Bears, &amp; Tigers haue been tam'd,</span><br />
Thy wood borne rigour neuer will be done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which thinks for this thou euer shalt be fam'd;</span><br />
True, so thou shalt, but fam'd in infamie,<br />
Is worse then lyuing in obscuritie.<br />
<br />
If thou didst knowe howe greeuous tis to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to lyue in this vnhabited aboade,</span><br />
Where none (but sorrowe) keepes me companie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know thou wouldst thy harts hate then vnload,</span><br />
Oh, I did ne're deserue this miserie,<br />
For to denie the truth were heresie.<br />
<br />
I tell thee (Loue) when secret-tongued night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">puts on her mistie sable-coloured vayle,</span><br />
My wrangling woes, within them selues do fight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">they murder hope, which makes their Captaine wayle,</span><br />
And wailing so, can neuer take his rest,<br />
That keepes such vnrul'd Souldiers in his brest.<br />
<br />
So when the cleere nights-faults-disclosing day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">peepes forth her purple head, from out the East,</span><br />
These woes (my Souldiers) crie out for their pay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(and if deni'd) they stab mee, with vnrest;</span><br />
My teares are pay, but all my teares are dride<br />
Therefore I must their fatall blowes abide.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><br />
In these laments did <i>Dom Diego</i> liue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">long time; till at the last by pourefull fate,</span><br />
A wandring Huntsman ignorance did driue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vnto the place whence hee return'd but late;</span><br />
Who viewing well the print of humaine steps<br />
Directly followed them, and for ioy leaps.<br />
<br />
At last hee came vnto <i>Diegoes</i> Caue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in which he sawe a sauadge man (hee thought)</span><br />
Who much did looke like the <i>Danubyan</i> slaue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">such deep-worn furrows in his face were wrought,</span><br />
<i>Diego</i> much abashed at this sight<br />
Came running forth, him in his armes to plight.<br />
<br />
For glad hee was (God knowes) to see a man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who (wretch) in two yeres space did ne're see any</span><br />
Such gladnes, ioy, such mirth, such triumph can<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">not be set downe, suppose them to be many.</span><br />
But see, long had they not confer'd together,<br />
When (happie time) each one did know the other.<br />
<br />
VVith that <i>Diego</i> shewes him all his loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his pennance, her first loue, &amp; now her hate,</span><br />
But hee requested him hence to remoue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and at his house the rest hee should dilate,</span><br />
Which hee deni'd, onely hee now doth write<br />
By this his friend, vnto his harts delight.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><br />
Deere Loue (quoth he) when shall I home returne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wh&#275; will the coales of hate be quencht with loue,</span><br />
VVhich now in raging flames my hart do burne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">oh, when wilt thou this thy disdaine remoue;</span><br />
Aske of this bearer, be inquisitiue,<br />
And hee will tell thee in what case I liue.<br />
<br />
Inquire of her, whose Hawke hath caus'd this woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">if for that fauour euer I did loue her,</span><br />
And shee will curse mee that did vse her so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and shee will tell thee how I lou'd another;</span><br />
Twas thee <i>Gyneura</i>, twas thy fairest selfe,<br />
I hel'd thee as a Pearle, her drossie pelfe.<br />
<br />
Then, when thou hast found out the naked truth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thinke of thy <i>Diego</i>, and his hard hap,</span><br />
Let it procure in thee some mouing ruth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that thus hast causelesse cast him from thy lap:</span><br />
Fare-well my deere, I hope this shall suffize,<br />
To ad a period to thy cruelties.<br />
<br />
The Messenger to spurre forth her desires,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and hasten her vnto his well-lou'd friend,</span><br />
Tells her, how hee lyes languishing in fires<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">of burning griefes, which neuer will haue end:</span><br />
Bids her to flye to him with wings of zeale,<br />
And thus <i>Diegoes</i> paines hee doth reueale.<br />

Oh Adamantick-minded Mayde (quoth hee)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">why linger you in this ambiguous thought,</span><br />
Open thine eyes, no longer blinded bee,<br />

Vnbolt thy harts strong gate of hardest steele,<br />
O let him nowe the warmth of pittie feele.<br />
<br />
Oh let him now the warmth of pittie feele,<br />

Wanting loues foode hee here &amp; there doth reele<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">lyke to a storme-tost Ship that's far from shore.</span><br />
Feede him with loue that long hath fed on cares,<br />
Be Anchor to his soule that swims in teares.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">rig and amend his trouble-beaten face,</span><br />
O calme thy hate, whose winds haue rais'd his smart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">see him not perrish in this wofull case.</span><br />
And for in Sea-salt teares hee long hath liu'd,<br />
Let him by thy fresh water be relieu'd.<br />
<br />
Oh, shall I tell thee how I found him there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his house wherein hee liu'd (if lyue hee did,</span><br />
Or rather spend his time in dying feare)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">was built within the ground, all darksom hid.</span><br />

In whose concauity winds breath'd horce grones,<br />

O'regrowne it was with mighty shadefull Trees,<br />

To this black place repaired euery morne,<br />

Bringing the poore <i>Diego</i> so forlorne,<br />

Full loath they were to loose such christall springs,<br />

Else wilt thou make vs pine in griefe-full woe,<br />
That nere knewe care, or loue, or friend, or foe.<br />
<br />
Straight (like a shooting Commet in the ayre)<br />

That know not loue, nor feele his miseries.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span><br />
Melts not thy hart (<i>Gyneura</i>) at his cares?<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">remaines there yet disdaines within thy mind?</span><br />
Disgorge thy hate, O hate him not that loues thee,<br />

Be it nere sayd that faire <i>Gyneuraes</i> beauty,<br />

Cruell to him that merrits curtesie,<br />

Too long it were to tell thee all his merits,<br />

Post-hast of thine must now reuiue his spirits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or shortly he will gaspe his latest breath;</span><br />

And stealingly there glides with heauy pace<br />
A Riuolet of Pearle along her face.<br />
<br />
O cease (quoth she) to wound me any more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with oft repeating of my cruelties,</span><br />
Thou of thy teares (kind man) hast shed great store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when I (vnkinder mayde) scarce wet mine eyes.</span><br />
O let me now bewaile him once for all,<br />
Twas none but I that causd his causelesse thrall.<br />
<br />
Eternall <i>Ioue</i>, rayne showers of vengeance on me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">plague me for this blacke deed of wrongful hate,</span><br />
Be blind mine eyes, they shall not looke vpon thee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Diego</i>, till thou be compassionate:</span><br />
And when thou doost forgiue what I haue done,<br />
Then shall they shine like shortest-shaded sunne.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span><br />
O slacke thy swift-pac'd gallop winged Tyme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">turne backe, and register this my disdaine;</span><br />
Bid Poets sing my hate in ruthfull ryme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and pen sad Iliads of <i>Diegoes</i> paine:</span><br />
Let them be writ in plain-seene lines of glasse,<br />
To shew how louing he, I, cruell was.<br />
<br />
Hereat shee pausd, tell me sweet sir quoth shee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">how I might see my deere-embosom'd friend,</span><br />
That now (if what is past may pardned be)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vnto his griefes I may impose an end;</span><br />
Where-with they both agreed, that the next day,<br />
They would eniourney them without more stay.<br />
<br />
Long were they not, Desire still goes on Ice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and nere can stay tell that he hath his wish,</span><br />
Mens willing mindes each thing doth soone intice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to hast to y<sup>t</sup> which they would faine accomplish.</span><br />
But that they came (as hauing a good guide)<br />
Vnto the place where they <i>Diego</i> spide.<br />
<br />
Sacred <i>Pympl&aelig;ides</i> endip my quill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">within the holy waters of your spring,</span><br />
Infuze into my braine some of your skill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that ioyfully of these I now may sing:</span><br />
These Louers now twixt whom late dwelt annoy,<br />
Swymming in seas of ouer-whelming ioy.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span><br />
But, pardon mee you Dames of Helycon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">for thus inuoking your diuinest ayde,</span><br />
Which was by me (vnworthy) call'd vpon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">at your rare knowledge I am much dismaide;</span><br />
My barren-witted braines are all too base,<br />
To be your sacred learnings resting place.<br />
<br />
Thus, of themselues, in pleasures extasie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">these Louers now embrace them in theyr armes,</span><br />
Speechlesse they are, eye counterfixt on eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">like two that are coniur'd by magique charmes.</span><br />
So close their armes were twin'd, so neer they came<br />
As if both man and woman were one frame.<br />
<br />
In th'end, (as doth a Current lately stayd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">rush mainly forth his long-imprisoned flood)</span><br />
So brake out words; and thus <i>Dyego</i> sayd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">what my <i>Gyneura</i>? O my harts chiefe good,</span><br />
Ist possible that thou thy selfe should'st daigne<br />
In seeing me to take so wondrous paine.<br />
<br />
Oh, speake not of my paine (my deerest loue)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">all paine is pleasure that I take for thee,</span><br />
Thou that so loyall and so true doost proue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">might scorne mee now, so credulous to be:</span><br />
Then sweet <i>Diego</i>, let vs now returne,<br />
And banish all things that might make vs mourne.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span><br />
Twere infinite to tell of their great gladnes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">theyr amorous greetings, &amp; their soules delight,</span><br />
<i>Diego</i> now had exil'd griefe and sadnes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">rauisht with ioy whilst he enioyde her sight.</span><br />
Let it suffise, they homeward now retire,<br />
Which suddaine chance both men &amp; maids admire.<br />
<br />
<i>Gyneura</i> now delights but in his presence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">shee cannot once endure him from her sight,</span><br />
His loue-ful face is now her soules sole essence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and on his face shee dotes both day and night.</span><br />
She nere did once disdaine him halfe so much,<br />
As now she honors him, loues force is such.<br />
<br />
<i>Diego</i> now wrapt in a world of pleasure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">imparadiz'd in hauing his desire,</span><br />
Floting in Seas of ioy aboue all measure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">sought means to mittigate loues burning fire,</span><br />
VVho walking with his loue alone one day,<br />
Discharg'd his minde, and thus began to say.<br />
<br />
O faire <i>Gyneura</i>, how long wil't be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">ere safron-robed <i>Hymen</i> doe vnite vs?</span><br />
My soule doth long that happy howre to see.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O let the angry Fates no longer spight vs,</span><br />
Lingring delays will teare my greeued hart,<br />
Let me no longer feele so painefull smart.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span><br />
<i>Gyneura</i>, which desir'd it as her life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">tells him that paine shall shortly haue a cure,</span><br />
Shortly quoth she, Ile be thy married wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">ty'de in those chaynes which euer wil endure,</span><br />
Be patient then, and thou shalt plainly see,<br />
In working it, how forward I will be.<br />
<br />
And so she was; no time dyd she mispend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wherein shee gets not things in readines,</span><br />
That might to <i>Hymens</i> rites full fitly tend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or once conduce to such theyr happines,</span><br />
All things prepar'd, these Louers now are chayned<br />
In marriage bands, in which they long remained.<br />
<br />
These, whilst they liu'd, did liue in all content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">contending who should loue each other most,</span><br />
To w<sup>c</sup> pure loue, proude Fame her eares down lent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and through the world, of it doth highly boast.</span><br />
O happy he to whom loue comes at last,<br />
That will restore what hate before did wast.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">{ Then (deerest loue) <i>Gyneuryze</i> at the last, }</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">{ And I shall soone forget what ere is past.&nbsp; &nbsp;}</span><br />
<br />
And now farewel, when I shal fare but ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">flourish &amp; ioy, wh&#275; I shal droope and languish,</span><br />
All plentious good awaite vpon thy will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wh&#275; extreame want shal bring my soule deaths anguish.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Forced by thee (thou mercy-wanting mayd)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">must I abandon this my natiue soyle,</span><br />
Hoping my sorrowes heate will be allayd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">by absence, tyme, necessity or toyle.</span><br />
So, nowe adiew; the winds call my depart.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy beauties excellence, my rudest quill</span><br />
Shall neuer-more vnto the world impart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">so that it know thy hate, I haue my will;</span><br />
And when thou hear'st that I for thee shall perrish,<br />
Be sorrowfull. And henceforth true loue cherrish.</div>

And left their sauage Nature, if there long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">they did with his sweet Melodie remaine.</span><br />
Wolues lost their preyes, and by signes praid him sing<br />
Beasts left the Lyon, and chose him their King.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet of them all, not one could immitate.</span><br />

Tis saide when <i>Orpheus</i> dyed, he did descend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the infernall, so the <i>Furies</i> boast:</span><br />
Where now they giue him leaue his eies to bend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">without all feare, on her whome he once lost,</span><br />
By a regardant looke, but tis not so:<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vpon the death of his <i>Euridice</i>:</span><br />
Which still he sung, as if his former feare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of loosing her was now, or else would be.</span><br />
The Eccho beate the noyse vp to the Spheares,<br />
And to his passionate song, Gods bent their eares.<br />

<br />
He ch&#257;g'd his shape, his wings he oft hath torne,<br />

With gold tipt <i>Iauelin</i> and a bugle Horne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">such as they beare to make the Lyon tame:</span><br />
First did he kisse hir hand, which then did melt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with loue's impression, <i>Cupid</i> the like felt:</span><br />

By thee faire Maid a power farre aboue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart is the true index of my tongue.</span><br />
And by my naked wordes you may discouer,<br />

Of able Epithits, so what praise I giue<br />
Makes not you ritcher though it makes me poore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">therefore in vaine against the streame I striue,</span><br />
Th'ore curious painter, meaning to excell,<br />

That euen the blending roses were espyed<br />

She threw her thin breath through the lawne, and said<br />

Let him tame Man, that is the Lyons King,<br />

Now <i>Cupid</i> hangs the head, and melts in shame,<br />

Faine would she die, yet first would pleased be<br />

Time still ranne on, with an auerted face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and nothing but her passions did her good.</span><br />

Like to a fountaines head, so shew'd her head,<br />

<br />
She tooke the haltar, and held vp her chin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">chafing her temples with a violent heate:</span><br />
Making her soule returne with torments in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as it went out, being come vnto retrait,</span><br />

Shewes like a faire house, haunted with a spirit.<br />

Nor can it with the short cut of my breath,<br />

Now had she time to waile, and well she might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guiltie of sorrow, there might you haue seene:</span><br />
As glow wormes adde a tincture to the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glimmering in pallid fire, vppon some greene,</span><br />
mixt with the dew, so did her eyes appeare,<br />
Each goulden glance ioyn'd with a dewy teare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">oft shut her eyes, like starres that portend ill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with bloody deluge, they their orbes did fill.</span><br />
<br />
The Nurse amated with the latter wordes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose aged haires stood vp like siluer wire:</span><br />
Knew speech was vaine, where will the scope affords<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; whispering softly, saies childe thy desire</span><br />
Ile put into thy armes, sleepe, seize thy head,<br />
Tis now nights no one, all but the stars seem dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our vanities like fire-works will ascend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vntil they breake, vncertaine where to end.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><br />
Neuer did mortall with a vicious thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wish to bring vices Embrion to aforme:</span><br />
But still the prince of darknesse to them brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">occasions fore-locke, which they off have torne.</span><br />
Sin like a Cedar shadowes all our good:<br />
Whilst vertues bounded like a narrow flood.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As see now, how the occasion of misfortune;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mirrha's much abus'd-mother did importune.</span><br />
<br />
Now came the time, of <i>Ceres</i> sacred rite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and Misteries, when all wives young and olde</span><br />
Cloathed in vailes, all of transparent white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kneele to her, and to the Attick priest vnfolde,</span><br />
The firstlings of the fiel'd wreath'd gilded corne,<br />
Chaplets of dill, pluckt in a blushing morne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many such, nor may they husbands see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In nine daies, till they end their misterie.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><br />
Now nurse was double diligent, watching her time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and told old <i>Cynitas</i> a louely maide</span><br />
Sigh'd for him: and still with cupps of wine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">betwixt each word his pallat she assaide.</span><br />
Heated with wines, he bad the Nurse repaide,<br />
and bring to him the Maide that was so faire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Bacchus</i> &amp; <i>Venus</i>, Wine and frolicke lust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">are sworne to blood, and keepe togither must.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Mirrha</i> no sooner heard this glad reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but as a poore bird long time in a snare,</span><br />
Ready for fammine and her woe to die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whom an vnskilful fouler vnaware</span><br />
hath guiuen freedome, to her foode doth hast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">so Mirrha thought each houre an age was past:</span><br />
In her strict torments but being scapt away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">her woes forgot, she thinkes vppon her prey.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><br />
And as she did ascend those staires to lust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in the midway, she heard her father speake:</span><br />
And nere lay partridge closer to the dust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">at sound o' the Faulccons bell, then she too weak</span><br />
To encounter or resist: and feares are such,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in loue by loue, that they enccrease loue much.</span><br />
Loue like to Monarkes, hath his state hie reared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who euer wil be lou'd, where they are feared.</span><br />
<br />
To a hundred seueral passions she doth yeeld,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and as we see in Autumne of the yere</span><br />
Some gallant oake stand ready to be feld,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vppon whose ribs a hundred wounds appeare</span><br />
Forc'd by the brawnie armes of Hynds vnlithe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who workes a passage to the weeping pith:</span><br />
Vncertaine (though wind shaken) where to fall:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">so stood her mynd doutful of rest at al.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span><br />
Nurse opes the doore, and brings her to the bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the darkenesse of the night abated shame:</span><br />
And leaues her that must leaue her maiden head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to the begetter of his owne defame,</span><br />
With faultring hams hauing got twixt the sheetes,<br />
In fearefull lust this <i>Prodegi&aelig;</i> meetes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He begs a kisse, then blusht she as he spake it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">yet he must giue it, shee wants power to take it.</span><br />
<br />
Now trembling lay she by her fathers side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">like filly doue within the Eagles gripe:</span><br />
Nor doth she vse soft shrikes as doth a bride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I meane a maide) when as the fruite so ripe</span><br />
Of maiden-head, forced from their wombe,<br />
Her fathers armes to her was as a tombe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She dead in pleasure, durst not shew her voice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">least <i>Cyniras</i> should know this faire foule choice.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span><br />
But when that Cupid once had whetted her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">she twines her lilly stalks about his necke:</span><br />
So clings young <i>Ivie</i> bout the aged oake there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Venus</i> smile, but frowning <i>Iuno</i> checks.</span><br />
Their stolne delight, no nuptiall tapers shone,<br />
No Virgin belt vntyed, but all vndone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the Athenian God, kindled no hallowed fires,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">darke was the night, suiting to their desires.</span><br />
<br />
The morrow came, toyled with wakes and lust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">she leaues her father, when as the rising Sun</span><br />
Couering the easterne Pines and mountaine dust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">spyed Mirrha from her couch of sin to runne.</span><br />
Then blusht he first, and backward would ha fled<br />
And euer since in's rising hee's still red,<br />
Nere Turkas was at sicke blood more estrang'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">then Mirrha when her chastitie was chang'd.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><br />
Oft would she leane against her fathers knees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; tie his garter in a true loue's knot:</span><br />
And then vndoo't againe, as to shew she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">were vndone, yet he conceiu'd it not.</span><br />
And woman like that, keep not secrets long,<br />
she shewd her loue in d&#363;b shewes with out tung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">her lust she knew (yet hardly it concealde)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">like Fayries Treasur's vanish'd if reueal'd.</span><br />
<br />
A third night came, darker then shores belowe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">when Cyniras (father of feareful lust)</span><br />
Willing to see the foule that did bestowe<br />
So many pleasures on him (Ioue is iust)<br />
Did reach a taper, whose confusiue light,<br />
Strucke like a blasting at that horrid sight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light fell from him loathing his defame,</span><br />
things senceles oft are mou'd, wh&#275; men not shame.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><br />
At length with bloodie eye fixed on her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">out of an Iuorie scabberd hanging by:</span><br />
He drew a monumental Semiter,<br />
thinking with death that both their shames shold dye<br />
But night that oft befriended her with sinne,<br />
In her blacke wombe too, did her freedome win,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For through the darke she slipt, and left her fire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to mourne his Fate, not execute his ire.</span><br />
<br />
Sped with her lust, and flying thence apace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">in feares and trembling, feare doth giue vs eies:</span><br />
For saftie to the Gods, she lifts her face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; her claspt hands to what she now not see's,</span><br />
loues browe was darke, Boetes had amaine<br />
Driuen his Oxen to the lower plaine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pheb&aelig; fled heauen, her face no tincture beares,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because shee saw a deed, worthie her teares.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span><br />
The morning came, where yet the fatall print<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">of Mirrha lay vpon the pillow: <i>Cynix</i> he</span><br />
Clog'd with distresse, a fathers cursse did hint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vpon that place of foule inchastitie,</span><br />
the sight of what we loath, breedes loathing more<br />
and vertue once renounc'd ingenders store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaue we him touz'd in care, for worldly wee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">loue to leaue great men in their miserie.</span><br />
<br />
Seauen winters nights, she fled before the Moone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(who knew the vnchaste act she had inforc'd)</span><br />
Through <i>Arabie</i>, in feare she posteth soone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To odorous Panchaia, whose confines diuorc'd</span><br />
Her fathers land: here grew all choicest fumes:<br />
That to Ioues temples often men presumes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and on his altars them accumulate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and how they first sprung, here thereof the Fate.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span><br />
<i>Heb&aelig;</i> now banish'd from th' <i>Aetherian</i> boule<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">vppon a feast day mongst the Gods aboue,</span><br />
Where twas made lawfull, all without controule,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">might freely drink it chanc'd the Queen of loue</span><br />
Whether she long'd, or enuied <i>Hebes</i> starre,<br />
(Women are enuious, where they long for nectar)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">forc'd her to skinke so much, the iuice ran ore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">so that Ioues drinke washt the defiled flore.</span><br />
<br />
With this he storm'd, that's Priests from altars flie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">streight banish'd <i>Heb&aelig;</i>, &amp; the world did thinke</span><br />
To a second Chaos they should turned be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the clouds for feare wept out th' immortal drinke</span><br />
and on <i>Panchaia</i> there this Nectar fell,<br />
Made rich th' adiacent lands with odorous smell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and such rare spices to the shoares are giuen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as Ioue would thinke no Nectar were in heauen.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span><br />
There was a Satire rough and barbarous,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">pleasing his pallat at a trembling spring:</span><br />
Vnder a Beech with bowes frondiferous,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">though he had seene a nimph or rarer thing</span><br />
Then flesh and blood, for in the calmed streame,<br />
He saw her eyes like stars, whose raies did gleame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Boue Phoebus farre, and so amazed stood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as if she had bin Goddesse of that flood.</span><br />
<br />
And as you see a man that hath bin long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Possessed with a furie of the shades:</span><br />
after some prayers and many a sacred song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with blessed signes, the euill spirit vades,</span><br />
so fell his rudenesse from him, and her shine,<br />
Made all his earthie parts pure and diuine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O potent loue, great is thy power be falne,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That makes the wife mad, &amp; the mad man calme.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><br />
Thus he begins, fairer then Venus farre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Venus be, or if she be tis thee:</span><br />
Louelie as Lillies, brighter then the starre<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that is to earth the mornings Mercurie:</span><br />
Softer then Roses, sweeter breath'd then they,<br />
blush't boue <i>A</i>urora, better cloath'd then May.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">lipt like a cherrie, but of rarer taste,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deuine as Dian, and as fully chaste.</span><br />
<br />
Pardon my rude tongue, if I chance to erre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as Hermes selfe might erre being the God</span><br />
of Eloquence: for your bright eye doth beare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">all earthly blessings in a faire abode,</span><br />
Excuse me if I trip, I meane your weale,<br />
Error's no error, where tis done with zeale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loue like materiall fires is made to flame:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When tis supprest with fanning Fires first came.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><br />
With this, the Maid (so took) hung down her head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">wondring that such a shape had such a tongue:</span><br />
able to steale her loue, had she not fled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and from his ardent gripes, her body wrung.</span><br />
Flying like <i>Pheb&aelig;</i> after strucken deere:<br />
and as he follow'd she fled more for feare.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Zephire</i> came foorth, to dally with her haire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">while the poore Satire cried stay maide so faire.</span><br />
<br />
But he on sudden like a subtill Snake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">rould in a heape, shootes foorth himself at l&#275;gth;</span><br />
and to his vigorous armes greedie doth take,<br />
his yeilding prey, won with his words not str&#275;gth<br />
To be a woman, is by nature giuen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: -0.5em;">But to be constant, is a star, which heauen</span><br />
Hath seald on their sex forehead as a signe,<br />
That constancie in women is diuine.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><br />
Thou didst deceiue me Mirrha, when I saide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thou flew'st for feare, thou gau'st me cause to fear</span><br />
and I might iustlie haue this gainst thee laide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thou wentst t' auide by pathes that were so nere</span><br />
Who begin, ill most often end in ill,<br />
and she that doth her first pure youth so spill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lawles lust, though made a wife to one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remaines like wax for each impression.</span><br />
<br />
But see the goodnesse of the Deities,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who still with grace preuents our ill presage,</span><br />
This groue was hallow'd to no Hiadres,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">but chast Diana, who with violent rage</span><br />
Discending from her towre of Christalline,<br />
To keepe the place still sacred and diuine:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">against her rites, brought with her thereupon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">white Poplar from the banckes of <i>Acheron</i>:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span><br />
Then with a charme, that did her face eclips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made her crescent quak, the iuice she powers</span><br />
Vpon the Satirs face, and prophane lipps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which quickly ouer all his body showers,</span><br />
Her borrow'd power of art being finished:<br />
(Deriued from Ph&oelig;bus as her light) she saide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nine-times the holy rime, which spok will clere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">all prophane matter, and this spake she there.</span><br />
<br />
Sleepe Poplar sleepe, that was the Satirs name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who had bin long a king within these woods,</span><br />
Since thou my sacred Groue, gan to prophane:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">a sleepe seize on thee, still as stigian floods,</span><br />
by Stix I vow the partiall destenies,<br />
Did they conspire, shold nere vnclaspe thin eies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'haning'.">hauing</ins> thus said, the Satire vanisht so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as mens prospect that from a mirrour goe.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span><br />
I thinke (quoth she) accursed is this place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">for heere the man, for whome I sorrow now,</span><br />
Heedelesse Acteon with immodest face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">saw all our naked and did ouer-vewe:</span><br />
As men rich iuells doe, thinking there lies<br />
yet some rare vertue hidden from their eyes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And euen there quoth shee, &amp; then did point,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">reuen'gd, I saw his hounds teare ioint from ioint.</span><br />
<br />
But since saies she, thou as a King didst reigne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and art a Trophey too of <i>Dians</i> power:</span><br />
Thus much the Goddesse of the floods doth deign<br />
to change thy shape, into a vertick flower.<br />
Then thrice three words, thrice striking charmed wood<br />
The ground did crannie, and there out of hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">appeared greene Poplar, younger then before,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which bow'd the head &amp; dyan did adore.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span><br />
The palefac'd Mirrha sat like guiltie spright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">fore the infernall iudge, yet did not see</span><br />
Diana great, for dull are mortalls sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(and all inuisible is chastitie)</span><br />
But heard a voice as she was vanishing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">saying defild maide, doost wonder at this thing?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Mirrha ere my crescents beautie change,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thou shalt be turn'd into a shape as strange.</span><br />
<br />
With this the verdant new sprung Poplar plant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(moou'd with the winde) seemd to bow down the head</span><br />
as cheering Mirrha, who did comfort want<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">being amaz'd at what Diana saide,</span><br />
Hauing recouer'd sence, she flies the place,<br />
For feare of Pheb&aelig;s comming to the chace:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to Saba land she hies, where all affraide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">my muse shall sing the downfall of the Maide.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span><br />
Then first hung downe Poplar his heauie braine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">for Mirrha's losse, whose loue brought him that</span><br />
and for he once in woods a King did raigne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">a crowne hee still wear's, richly wrought with blew</span><br />
and yellow eke, as figures both of loue,<br />
Which Venus dropt downe him from aboue.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bacchus doth loue him, for in feasts of wine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">he weares a poplar Garland mixt with vine.</span><br />
<br />
The leaden God of sleepe, on his iuice feede,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the vertues of him, sundry doe declare:</span><br />
His suddain taste a heauinesse doth breede,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and drownes in rest, sences opprest with care,</span><br />
In places farre remote, he loues to growe,<br />
and eke by rivers that runne thicke and slowe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">where drowsilie this woodish demie God,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with euerie gale of winde his head doth nod.</span><br />

wh&#275; her drie brain, no more teares could expose<br />

<br />
Distressed twixt the teadiousnesse of life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and trembling feare of death, she thus began:</span><br />
For when we cease to be the crimes are rife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">which youth committed, and before vs then.</span><br />
For aged memorie doth clasp't containe,<br />
Those shapes of sin, which hot blood held as vain.<br />

To speake of him, whose bed I haue defilde,<br />

So fares it now with thee my virgin iem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whome nature would call sonne but shame saies brother</span><br />
Shall I not blush when thou art ripe, to gather<br />
The circumstances of who was thy Father,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">yes sure I shall, yet shame forgets all shame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ile charge thy father of a heauenly name.</span><br />

But oh, I feare me least some Prodegie,<br />

to fright ee'n the yron age, that chastitie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">might take example by my suffering.</span><br />
That I a monster-mother should be made,<br />
If soe, O ouer equall Gods, let <i>Mirrha</i> fade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">into some shape, worthy your high deuice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pitty to me, would make Ioue seeme vnwise.</span><br />
<br />
Alter O Gods, death that is due to birth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">nor let the dead repine, that I should see</span><br />
Eliziums blest shades, nor the men of earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">annoided be with my impuritie,</span><br />
Let them enioy the fieldes, and learned Songes,<br />
Of hye brow'd Orpheus, let the vnflesht thronges<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that haue deseru'd this, and much more be glad,</span><br />

at my sad story orebrim with your teares,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">you'le drowne in teares, or labour so no more.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or else I feare the nere-erturned dead</span><br />
Clad in the fearefull shapes of night and hell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">will rife before the general day be spred;</span><br />
and hurrie me in flesh to Acheron,<br />
To taste hels torture both in soule and bone:<br />

The Gods to her last wish was tractable.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">her tongue percullist twice was as she spake:</span><br />
aire was her voice, and Mirrha now not able,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to thanke the Gods, her ioynts in sunder brake.</span><br />
Leaues were her locks, of golden haire bereau'd,<br />
her armes long boughes, deem &amp; be not deceiu'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">tree gan she be, yet twixt her thing so staid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">you could not say she was or tree or maide.</span><br />
<br />
First grew her hayre v<sup>p</sup> like the Summer Corne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or as a blazing starre whose streames rise vpward</span><br />
&amp; being changd, fell leaues, that vp were borne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">by the rude windes, yet had you but haue heard</span><br />
You'd sware, a sigh for Mirrha's transmigration<br />
Had beene decreed by all the windie nation.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and euerie Autume, since a thing moste rare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The falling leaues, resemble Mirrha's haire.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><br />
To barke her yuorie skin polisht congeald,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">each blew rig'd current into melting sap,</span><br />
Her nailes to bolssome faire, &amp; what reueal'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with accents sad, the babe yet in her lap.</span><br />
Her fingers twigs, her bright eyes turn'd to gum,<br />
Buried on earth, and her owne selfe the toombe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">her sences gone, yet this sence did she win,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to aye relent, the horror of her sinne.</span><br />
<br />
For euen as from a guilty man, that's pleading for remorse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">teares follow teares, as hoping to preuaile,</span><br />
So from this tree, (though now a senceleffe course)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">flowe pretious teares, as seemes she doth bewaile</span><br />
In death, with euer liuing teares, the act fore-done<br />
These <i>Pius</i> drops, made densiue by the sunne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">are kept for holy vses, and the Mir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That so distilles, doth beare the name of her.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span><br />
The misbegotten babie, swels the tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and loathing the defiled wombe sought vent:</span><br />
Those panges that mothers haue felt shee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and solemne sighes had issue, as they'd rent,</span><br />
and spoile the shape, she newly had assum'd,<br />
But wordes within the close bark were inhumbd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet wept it out, as it to water would,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or seem'd it mockt Pactolus waues of golde.</span><br />
<br />
Till chast Lucina, whome the Poets giue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mid-wiues power in producing creatures,</span><br />
by whose change we last die, and first doe liue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(be they not violent each) she that giues features</span><br />
Forme or takes away, makes foule or faire,<br />
Discending from her Spheare next to our ayre:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with armes yspred, vppon the melting mir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">brought diuine comfort downe from heau&#275; with her</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span><br />
Few wordes she spake, but euery sillable,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">of power to comfort the afflicted Ghostes;</span><br />
Or any other sencelesse thing make able,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">doe better deedes then those <i>Alcides</i> boastes,</span><br />
the tree streight craynes, &amp; springs forth the child<br />
who the first minut, though his countenance smild<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">cryed out a maine, our first propheticke breath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">showes our first houre, is mother to our death.</span><br />
<br />
The water Nymphes then caught him tenderly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">who laid him streight on the enameled bankes,</span><br />
and bath'd him with his mothers teares, whereby<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">they made him fairer, and in merry prankes</span><br />
The Ladies call a conuocation there,<br />
Some praise his nose, his lips, his eye, his eare.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some his streight fingers, whilst a fist doth sweare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">his verry breath yet smelleth of the mirre.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><br />
Another wishes, oh for such a face!<br />
Nor can I blame her though she did wish so:<br />
For sure, were I a wench, t'had bin my case,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">for nature heere, made both her ioy and woe,</span><br />
And spight that (but herself) commendeth none,<br />
Of force must say, this was a rarer one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then either nature did, or ere shall make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">whose life holdes vp her age, whose deathe's her wrack.</span><br />
<br />
Eyes like two stars falne from their proper sphears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">as if they scorn'd the beaten pathes of heauen:</span><br />
Or enuying of beautie of the beares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">showne firmer heere, and brighter then the seau&#275;</span><br />
Such was he as was Cupid wont to be<br />
In pictures lim'd, and that they may agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">furnish the babe with winges and quiuer light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">or from loues God, take wings, and quier quite.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><br />
Nought may compare with Time in his swift race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">the babe ere while feeles now youths hot alarms</span><br />
And as in yeares, so beautious grew his face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that he is fit againe for Ladies armes:</span><br />
Nor Cupid now could wound more dames th&#275; he<br />
That Venus who Captiues all, is not free<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From her own power, she loue's Adonis milde,</span><br />
That Mars doth storm, &amp; wish he were no childe.<br />
<br />
Nor Paphos, Amathus nor fishie Gnide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">delights she now to haunt, nor Etna now</span><br />
Burnes more then her, she roans the wood so wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">after her game, that to his game doth bow.</span><br />
And will not heare or see, for eies and eares,<br />
If they her heare or see, their vse forbeares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet she persues, and leaues her power vn euen</span><br />
on heauen &amp; earth, she loues him more th&#275; heau&#275;.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span><br />
Oft would she say, and bathe those words in tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">oh thou fair boy, wold God thou loudst like me</span><br />
but sure thou art not flesh, it well appeares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">thou wert the stubborne issue of a tree,</span><br />
So hard thou art, then she a sigh would fet,<br />
and wish that Vulcan had not made his net,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For boysterous Mars, shee'd fayner ha' bin sped</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">with this choice floure, claspt in her yron bed.</span><br />
<br />
Shee'd nere haue blusht, th&#275; she does make a vow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">though al the Gods of both worlds had th&#275; seen</span><br />
She raveth that she euer lou'd til now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">that she might worthily ha bin loues Queene.</span><br />
wel, wel (quoth she) thou hast reueng'd the spight<br />
which from my accurst Sons bow did fowly light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On thy faire Mother, O immortall boy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though thou be faire, tis I that should be coy.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span><br />
But stay my Muse in thine owne confines keepe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&amp; wage not warre with so deere lou'd a neighbor,</span><br />
But hauing sung thy day song, rest &amp; sleepe<br />

And to the great Sea-cost his bounds did bring,<br />
Whose Empire so the <i>Grecians</i> did confront,<br />
That euen from <i>Pindus</i>, and <i>Thomao</i> Mont.<br />

Which thither death, and desolation brought,<br />

The <i>Grecian</i> Empires chaire, the which he sought<br />
For which a huge digested army fought.<br />
And at the last, distressed <i>Constantine</i>,<br />
And of all Christians did the Citty purge,<br />

Let <i>Italy</i> take heed, the New-moone threats,<br />
To reare his hornes on <i>Romes</i> great Capitall,<br />
And doth not <i>Rome</i> deserue such rough defeats,<br />
That should be mother of compassion all?<br />
And co&uuml;nite the states, and principall<br />
In league, and loue, which now for trifles iarre,<br />

Taxes of warre, to these climes had not come:<br />
Nor yet the <i>Turke</i> with all his barbarous hoast,<br />
Durst with the Catholikes such war commence,<br />
Where now they haue heard their drums, &amp; feard their hoast.<br />

Old fathers scourg'd with all base villanies?<br />

When <i>Mahomet</i> had man'd the wals, the towne surpriz'd<br />
Great grew the slaughter, bloudy waxt the fight,<br />
Like <i>Troy</i>, where all was fir'd, and all despis'd,<br />
But what stood gracious in the victors sight.<br />
Such was the wo of this great citty right:<br />
Here lay a Saint throwne downe, &amp; here a Nun,<br />
Rude <i>Sarazens</i> which no high God agnis'd,<br />
Made all alike our wofull course to run.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">8</span><br />
<br />
And in this deadly dealing of sterne death,<br />
And busie dole of euery Souldiers hand,<br />
Where swords were dul'd with robbing men of breath<br />
Whil'st rape with murder, stalk't about the land,<br />
And vengeance did performe her own command,<br />
and where 'twas counted sin to thinke amisse:<br />
There no man thought it ill to do all scath,<br />
O what doth warre respect of bale or blisse?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">9</span><br />
<br />
There stood an ancient Chappell next the Court,<br />
Where sacred Bishops said their morrow Masse.<br />
And sung sweet <i>Anthems</i> with a loud report,<br />
To that eternall God-head, whose sonne was,<br />
Sequestred from the Trinity to passe,<br />
Vnder the burthen of the holy Crosse,<br />
For our redemption, whose death did retort,<br />
The sting of Sathan, and restor'd our losse.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">10</span><br />
<br />
Hither was got of silly maides some few,<br />
Whom happily no Souldier yet had seas'd,<br />
Tendring their spotlesse vows, in child-cold dew,<br />
Of virgin teares, to haue the heauens appeas'd<br />
But teares too late, must be too soone displeas'd,<br />
And hither, like a Tyger from the chase,<br />
Recking in bloudy thoughts, and bloudy shew,<br />
Came <i>Amurath</i> himselfe to sacke the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">11</span><br />
<br />
In Armour clad, of watchet steele, full grim,<br />
Fring'd round about the sides, with twisted gold,<br />
Spotted with shining stars vnto the brim,<br />
Which seem'd to burn the spheare which did th&#275; hold:<br />
His bright sword drawn, of temper good and old,<br />
A full moone in a fable night he bore,<br />
On painted shield, which much adorned him,<br />
With this short Motto: <i>Neuer glorious more</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">12</span><br />
<br />
And as a Diamond in the dark-dead night,<br />
Cannot but point at beames on euery side,<br />
Or as the shine of Cassiop&aelig;a bright,<br />
Which make the zodiacke, where it doth abide,<br />
Farre more then other planets to be ey'd:<br />
So did faire <i>Hirens</i> eyes encounter his,<br />
And so her beames did terror strike his sight,<br />
As at the first it made e'm vale amisse.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">13</span><br />
<br />
O that faire beauty in distresse should fall,<br />
For so did she, the wonder of the east,<br />
At least, if it be wondrous faire at all,<br />
That staines the morning, in her purple nest,<br />
With guilt-downe curled Tresses, rosy drest,<br />
Reflecting in a cornet wise, admire,<br />
To euery eye whom vertue might appall.<br />
And Syren loue, inchant with amorous fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">14</span><br />
<br />
A thousand Bashawes, and a thousand more,<br />
Of <i>Ianizaries</i>, crying to the spoile,<br />
Come rushing in with him at euery dore,<br />
That had not Loue giuen Barbarisme the foile,<br />
The faire had beene dishonored in this while.<br />
But &ocirc; when beauty strikes vpon the heart:<br />
What musicke then to euery sence is bore,<br />
All thought resigning them, to beare apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">15</span><br />
<br />
For as amongst the rest, she kneel'd sad weeping,<br />
In tender passion by an altars side,<br />
And to a blessed Saint begins her creeping,<br />
He stood loue-wounded, what should her betide,<br />
Whilst she saw him turnd round, &amp; well nie died.<br />
Let darknes shroud quoth she, my soule in night,<br />
Before my honor be in <i>Mahounds</i> keeping,<br />
Prisoner to enuy, lust, and all vnright.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">16</span><br />
<br />
O, if thou beest a Souldier, lend thy sword,<br />
To ope the bosomes, where yet neuer lay,<br />
Ignoble Souldier, nor imperious Lord,<br />
Of all whom war hath grip'd into her sway,<br />
Onely remaine we few, let not this day,<br />
Begin with vs, who neuer did offend,<br />
Or else do all of vs one death afford,<br />
If not, kill me, who ne'r was Pagans friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">17</span><br />
<br />
But now (said <i>Mahomet</i>) thou shall be mine,<br />
Thine eies haue power to such a great mans hart,<br />
If then they worke on me to make me thine,<br />
Say thou art wrong'd? dishonor doth impart<br />
No loue, where he may force: but mine thou art,<br />
And shalt be only in thine own free choice,<br />
What makes me speake, makes me speak thus diuine<br />
Else could I threat thee with a conquerors voyce.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What you may do (said she) I do not know,<br />
But know you this, there is a thousand waies,<br />
To finde out night before my shamelesse brow,<br />
Shall meet that day in guilt of such misrayes.<br />
Oh how vniust art thou? the pagan sayes,<br />
To him which sues for a respecting eye,<br />
And no ignoble action doth allow,<br />
But honor, and thy faires to gratifie.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">19</span><br />
<br />
The effect of both is one (said she) both spils,<br />
And layes my shame o're mastred at thy feet,<br />
But greatnesse (said he) doth outface all ills,<br />
And maiesty (make sowre apparance sweete,<br />
Where other powers th&#275; greatnes doth cut meet?<br />
It doth indeed, said she, but we adore,<br />
More th&#275; a great Earth-monarch wh&#333; death kils,<br />
Mortall soules, thinke on th'immortall more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">20</span><br />
<br />
Alas faire Christian Saint (said <i>Mahomet</i>)<br />
So yong, and full of gray hair'd purity,<br />
These are but shifts of Friers, tales farre fet.<br />
Dearest, I'le teach thee my diuinity,<br />
Our Mecha's is not hung with Imagery,<br />
To tell vs of a virgin-bearing-sonne,<br />
Our adoration to the Moone is set,<br />
That pardons all that in the darke is done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">21</span><br />
<br />
O blinde religion, when I learne, said she)<br />
To hallow it, my body tombe my soule,<br />
And when I leaue the mid-day-sunne for thee,<br />
Blush Moone, the regent of the nether roule.<br />
What I hold deerest, that my life controule,<br />
And what I prize more precious then imagery,<br />
Heauens, grant the same my bane and ruine be,<br />
And where I liue, wish all my Tragedy.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">22</span><br />
<br />
A dreadfull curse replide the Saracen,<br />
But I will teach thee how to cousen it,<br />
An oath in loue may be vnsworne againe,<br />
<i>Ioue</i> markes not louers oathes euery whit,<br />
Thou wilt repent beside, when riper wit<br />
Shall make thee know the magicke of thine eies,<br />
How faire thou art, and how esteem'd of men,<br />
Tis no religion that is too precise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">23</span><br />
<br />
Nor is this all, though this might woo a Greeke,<br />
To wantonize with princely <i>Mahomet</i>,<br />
Much more by loues inuention could I speake,<br />
By which the coldest temper might be heate:<br />
But I must hence, a fitter time I'le set,<br />
To conquer thee, Bashawes these spare or spill,<br />
Saue <i>Mustapha</i> this maid, since her we like,<br />
Conduct vnto our Tent, now warre he will.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">24</span><br />
<br />
She like <i>Cassandra</i> thral'd and innocent,<br />
Wrang her white hands, &amp; tore her golden haire,<br />
Hal'd by the Eunuchs to the Pagans Tent,<br />
Speechlesse, and spotlesse, vnpittied, not vnfaire,<br />
Whiles he to make all sure, did repaire,<br />
To euery Souldier throughout the field,<br />
And gaue in charge matters of consequence,<br />
As a good generall, and a Souldier should.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">25</span><br />
<br />
Then sent he forth <i>Polidamus</i> to bid,<br />
The Drums &amp; Trumpets sound that daies retreit,<br />
For in his soule their ratling noyse he chid:<br />
For startling <i>Cupid</i>, whose soft bosome streight,<br />
Had lodg'd him, &amp; grew proud of such a freight.<br />
Beside the sword and fire had swept the streetes,<br />
And all did in the victors hands abide,<br />
Night likewise came, fit time for Loues stolne-sweets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">26</span><br />
<br />
Thus tumbling in conceits, he stumbled home,<br />
In the darke couerture of shady night,<br />
Cal'd for a torch, the which his chamber groome,<br />
With more then speedy haste did present light:<br />
To bed he went, as heauy in his spright,<br />
As loue, that's full of anguish makes the minde:<br />
Faine would he sleepe away this martirdome,<br />
But loues eyes open, when all else are blinde.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">27</span><br />
<br />
What do you talke of sleepe? talke of the <i>Greeke</i>,<br />
For being laid, he now grew almost mad,<br />
What is she not as faire (quoth he) to like,<br />
As <i>Phedria</i>, whom in <i>Corinth</i> once I had?<br />
With that he knock't his Eunuchs vp, and bad,<br />
One aske the <i>Grecian</i> maide, what was her name,<br />
What she made there, &amp; whom she came to see,<br />
And to what end into his Tent she came?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">28</span><br />
<br />
When he was gone, somewhat the fury staid,<br />
And beat more temperate in his liuer-vaine,<br />
Onely he could not choose but praise the maid,<br />
Whose eies fr&#333; his such <i>womanish</i> drops did strain<br />
Did not thy face (sigh'd he) such faires containe,<br />
It could not be, my heart thou couldst distract,<br />
But all abstracts of rarities are laid,<br />
In thy faire cheekes so feelingly compact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">29</span><br />
<br />
Thus made, what maiest thou not command,<br />
In mighty <i>Amuraths</i> wide Empery?<br />
My tributary loue, and not my land,<br />
Shall pay it homage to thy proud bent eye,<br />
And they who most abhorre idolatry,<br />
Shall tender Catholicke conceites to thee,<br />
O arme not honor still for to withstand,<br />
And make a foyle of loue, which dwels in me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">30</span><br />
<br />
By this time was the Carpet-page returned,<br />
And told the prince the <i>Greeke</i> was <i>Hiren</i> hight,<br />
But so she wept, &amp; sigh'd, &amp; grieu'd, &amp; mourn'd,<br />
As I could get no more (said he to night,<br />
And weeps (said <i>Amurath</i>) my loue so bright,<br />
Hence villaine, borrow wings, flie like the winde,<br />
Her beauteous cheeks with hot tears wil be burnd<br />
Fetch her to me: &ocirc; loue too deafe, too blinde!<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">31</span><br />
<br />
Then crossing both his armes athwart his breast,<br />
And sinking downe, he set a soule taught grone,<br />
And sigh'd, and beat his heart, since loue possest,<br />
And dwelt in it which was before his owne.<br />
How bitter is sweet loue, that loues alone,<br />
And is not sympathis'd, like to a man?<br />
Rich &amp; full cram'd, with euery thing that's best,<br />
Yet lyes bed-sicke, whom nothing pleasure can.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">32</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes he would inuoke sweet Poets dead,<br />
In their own shapes, to court the <i>maid</i> with words<br />
But then he fear'd least they her maidenhead<br />
Shold win fr&#333; him: th&#275; somtimes arms &amp; swords,<br />
His old heroike thoughts, new roome affoords,<br />
And to the field he would: but then loue speakes,<br />
And tels him <i>Hiren</i> comes vnto his bed,<br />
Which dasheth all, and all intendments breakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">33</span><br />
<br />
And lo indeed, the purple hangings drawne,<br />
In came faire <i>Hiren</i> in her night attire,<br />
In a silke mantle, and a smocke of lawne,<br />
Her haire at length, the beams of sweete desire)<br />
Her breasts all naked, &ocirc; inchanting fire!<br />
And siluer buskins on her feet she wore,<br />
Though all the floore with Carpet-worke was strawn<br />
Yet were such feet too good to tread that floore.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">34</span><br />
<br />
Now <i>Mahomet</i> bethinke thee what is best,<br />
Said she, compell me I will speake thy shame,<br />
And tell thy hatefull fact, at euery feast,<br />
Singers in balads shall berime thy name,<br />
And for dishonoring me spot thy faire fame:<br />
But if&mdash;: No more chast maid said <i>Mahomet</i>:<br />
Though in thy grant consists all ioy and rest,<br />
I will not force thee, till thou giue me it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">35</span><br />
<br />
But say I languish, faint, and grow forlorne,<br />
Fall sicke, and mourne: nay, pine away for thee,<br />
Wouldst then for euer hold me yet in scorne?<br />
Forbid my hopes, the comfort that should be<br />
In hopes in doating hopes which tire on me:<br />
O be not as some women be, for fashion,<br />
Like sun-shine daies in clouds of raine stil borne,<br />
The more you'l loue, the more shall grow my passion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">36</span><br />
<br />
And then he clasp'd her frosty hand in his,<br />
An orient pearle betwixt two mother shels,<br />
And seal'd thereon a hearty burning kisse,<br />
Kisses in loue, force more then charmes or spels,<br />
And in sweet language; hopes-desires foretels,<br />
Ah louely <i>Greeke</i>, what heart hast thou (quoth he)<br />
What art thou made of? fire dissolueth yee,<br />
Tygers relent, yet thoul't not pitty me.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">37</span><br />
<br />
Dwel'st thou on forme? I can confirme thee than,<br />
<i>Sibilla</i> liues to tell she did repent.<br />
Let <i>Latmus</i> speake what it of <i>Delia</i> can,<br />
And it will eccho her loue-languishment.<br />
Chaste eyes somtimes reflect kind blandishment:<br />
Beside, thy foueraigne will thy subiect be,<br />
Once a great king, now a despised man,<br />
A vassall, and a slaue to Loue and thee.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">38</span><br />
<br />
Why dost thou weep? tis I shold drown mine eies<br />
And burst my heart with languor, and dispaire,<br />
I whom thy vnrelenting thoughts despise,<br />
I who can woo thee by no sute, nor prayer,<br />
Yet doating mad for thee, &ocirc; cruell faire,<br />
I sweare by this diuine white daizy-hand,<br />
The loue I beare thee, in my heart it lies,<br />
Whose searching fire, no reason can withstand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">39</span><br />
<br />
Wilt thou be mine? here shalt thou liue with me,<br />
Free'd from oppression, and the Souldiers lust,<br />
Who if thou passe my Tent, will seize on thee,<br />
And they are rude, and what they will thou must.<br />
O do not to the common Kestrels trust,<br />
They are not as the Eagles noble kinde,<br />
But rough, and daring in all villany:<br />
Honor with me, with them scarce safety finde.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">40</span><br />
<br />
Honor and safety, both in true loue is,<br />
And <i>Mahomet</i> is zealous, &ocirc; loue him:<br />
With him ioy euery thing that tasts of blisse,<br />
Pompe, honor, pleasure, shews, and pastimes trim,<br />
Care dwels not where he dwels, nor sorrow grim<br />
Onely till now, that he for <i>Hiren</i> mournes:<br />
A Greeke whom he would bring to paradice,<br />
He ner'e took thought, but now he sighs &amp; burns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">41</span><br />
<br />
Wilt thou be his, on thee shall waite and tend,<br />
A traine of Nymphs, and Pages by thy side,<br />
With faunes, horse, coach, &amp; musicke which shall lend<br />
The spheares new notes in their harmonies pride.<br />
When thou wilt walke, and publikly be ey'd,<br />
To bring thee in thy hie way, cloath'd with flowers<br />
Shall sent like <i>Tempe</i> when the graces send,<br />
To meet each other in those fragrant bowers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">42</span><br />
<br />
At home shall comick Masques, &amp; night disports<br />
Conduct thee to thy pillow, and thy sheetes,<br />
And all those reuels which soft loue consorts,<br />
Shall entertaine thee with their sweetest sweets.<br />
And as the warlike God with <i>Venus</i> meetes,<br />
And dallies with her in the Paphian groue,<br />
Shall <i>Mahomet</i> in bed shew thee such sports,<br />
As none shall haue, but she which is his loue.<br />

Againe: No more againe (saies she) great king,<br />
I know you can do much, and all this to,<br />
But tell me when we loose so deere a thing,<br />
Shame can we take pride in, in publike shew:<br />
Think you the adulterate owle, then wold not so?<br />
No, no, nor state, nor honor can repure,<br />
Dishonor'd sheet's, nor lend the owle daies wing<br />
Ignoble shame a King cannot recure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">44</span><br />
<br />
Now say mine eies &amp; cheeks are faire, what then?<br />
Why so are yours, yet do I dote on you?<br />
Beauty is blacke, defam'd by wicked men,<br />
And yet must euery beauty make men sue?<br />
Too good is worse then bad, you seeme too true<br />
Too easie, passionate, loue-sicke, and kinde,<br />
Then blame not me, that cannot so soone ren<br />
Your course: the fault is in your forward minde.<br />

But say great prince, I had a wanton eye,<br />
Would you adde <i>Syrius</i> to the sommer sunne?<br />
And whurle hote flaming fire where tow doth lie<br />
By which combustion all might be vndone?<br />
For loke how mightier greater Kings do run<br />
Amisse, the fault is more pernicious,<br />
And opens more to shame and obloquy,<br />
Then what we erre in, or is done by vs.<br />

A Monarch, and a mighty Conquerour<br />
To doate, proues euery woman is his better,<br />
But I'le be true to thee (said he:) One houre<br />
(Said she;) but what for truth, when it is fitter<br />
We keepe our own, then haue a doubtful debter.<br />
But I will sweare, said he: So <i>Iason</i> did,<br />
Replide faire <i>Hiren</i>, yet who faithlesse more,<br />
or more inconstant to his sworne loues bed?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">47</span><br />
<br />
Too many mirrors haue we to behold,<br />
Of mens inconstancy, and womens shame.<br />
How many margent notes can we vnfold,<br />
Mourning for virgins that haue bene too blame?<br />
And shall I then run headlong to the flame?<br />
I blush, but it is you should be ashamed,<br />
For know, if that you neuer haue beene told,<br />
"Vertue may be inforc'd, but not defamed.<br />

Faire louely Prince, let warre your triumphs be,<br />
Go forward in the glittering course you run,<br />
The kingly Eagle strikes through <i>Atomie</i>,<br />
Those little moates that barre him from the Sun,<br />
Then let not both of vs be here vndone,<br />
You of your Conquest, I of Chastitie.<br />
And pardon my rude specch, for lo you see,<br />
I plead for life, and who's not loath to dye?<br />

<br />
Death of my fame, which oft proues mortal death<br />
Witnesse the Prince-forc'd chaste <i>Lucretia</i>,<br />
Ere I like her be rap'd, &ocirc; reaue my breath,<br />
And gainst thy nature, take a yeelding pray,<br />
That will embrace death, before thee this day.<br />
If thou loue me, shew it in killing me,<br />
Thy sword had neuer yet a chaster sheath,<br />
Nor thou, nor <i>Mahound</i> a worse enemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">50</span><br />
<br />
He heard nor this, nor ought of what she said,<br />
For all his senses now were turn'd to eyes,<br />
And with such fired gaze he view'd this maid,<br />
That sure I thinke not <i>Hermes</i> mysteries,<br />
Nor all his <i>Caducean</i> nouelties,<br />
That flow from him like a slye winding streame,<br />
(To which the Gods gladly their eares haue laid)<br />
Could once haue mou'd him from this waking dreame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">51</span><br />
<br />
But sighes he sends out on this embassie,<br />
Liegers that dye ere they returne againe,<br />
Poore substitutes to coape with chastity.<br />
She knew the pleading of their Liege was vaine,<br />
And all his teares like to a Mel-dew raine,<br />
That falles vpon the floures, to defloure.<br />
Yet, for twas tedious, she did aske him why,<br />
Each sigh was o're him such a conquerour.<br />

By heauen he swore, and made his Eunuch start,<br />
I sigh to coole Loues fire, then kist her hand:<br />
For know, thou wonder of the Easterne part,<br />
He need not counterfeite that can command:<br />
But by thy middle, <i>Cupids</i> coniuring wand,<br />
I am all loue, and faire beleeue my vow,<br />
Sprung from a Souldier, now a louers heart,<br />
He sweares to loue, that neuer lou'd till now.<br />

Not halfe so faire was <i>Hellen</i>, thy pre'cessor,<br />
On whom the firy brand of Troy did dote,<br />
For whom so many riuall kings to succour,<br />
Made many a mountaine pine on Symois floate,<br />
Whilst fame to this day, tels it with wide throat.<br />
<i>Hector</i> fell wounded in that warlike stir,<br />
<i>Peleus</i> did faint, <i>Aiax</i> that lusty warriour,<br />
Then blame not me, that loue one far 'boue her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">54</span><br />
<br />
Nature deuis'd her owne despaire in thee,<br />
Thine eye not to be match'd, but by the other,<br />
Doth beare the influence of my destiny.<br />
And where they stray, my soule must wander thither<br />
Beauty of beauty, mother of Loues mother.<br />
All parts he praises, coming to her lip,<br />
Currall beneath the waues, vermilion dye,<br />
And being so neere, he wold not ouerslip.<br />

Now tyres the famish'd Eagle on his pray,<br />
Incorporating his rude lips in hers,<br />
Sucking her balmey breath soft as he may:<br />
Which did more vigor, through his brest disperse,<br />
Such kisses louers vse at first conuerse.<br />
All parts were to that center drawne I wis,<br />
Close as the dew-wormes at the breake of day,<br />
That his soule shew'd, as t'were a melting kisse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">56</span><br />
<br />
Till breathles now, he breath'd into her loue,<br />
Who scorn'd to take possession by degrees,<br />
No law with her strange passion, will he proue,<br />
But hauing interest, scorn'd one inch to leese,<br />
<i>Cupid</i>, sheele set thee free withouten fees.<br />
But though his wings she well nie set on fire,<br />
And burn'd the shaft, that first her brest did moue,<br />
Yet <i>Cupid</i> would be Lord of her desire.<br />
<br />

Tis sayd, <i>Aurora</i> blushes euery morne,<br />
For feare that <i>Titan</i> should her fault espy,<br />
And blushes so did <i>Hirens</i> cheekes adorne,<br />
Fearing least <i>Mahomet</i> perceiu'd her eye.<br />
Louers are blind, and what could he espy.<br />
No, twas the hidden vertue of that kisse,<br />
That her chast lips were nere vs'd to beforne,<br />
That did vnframe her, and confirme her his.<br />

<br />
Louers beleeue, lips are inchanted baites,<br />
After fifteene, who kisses a faire maide,<br />
Had need to haue friends trusty of the fates,<br />
For by my muse (I sweare) I am a afraid,<br />
Hee's Iourney-man already in Loues trade.<br />
A kiffe is porter to the caue of loue,<br />
Well see, and you may enter all the gates:<br />
"Women were made to take what they reproue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">59</span><br />
<br />
A kisse is the first Tutor and instinct,<br />
The guider to the Paphian shrine and bowers.<br />
They who before ne're entred loues precinct,<br />
Kissing shall finde it, and his sundry powers.<br />
O how it moues this continent of aires,<br />
And makes our pulse more strong &amp; hye to beat,<br />
Making vs know when lips are sweetly linck't,<br />
That to those Kickshawes 'longs more dainty meate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">60</span><br />
<br />
And so indeed bewitched <i>Hiren</i> knowes,<br />
The pressure of his lips was not in vaine,<br />
Seldome proue women friends vnto their foes,<br />
But when with ouer kindnesse they are tane,<br />
So weake professors do swalow their owne bane:<br />
Shew them the axe they'l suffer martyrdome,<br />
But if promotion to them you propose,<br />
And flattery, then to the lure they come.<br />

<br />
Thus <i>Mahomet</i> blinds her with <i>Cupids</i> vaile,<br />
And this new conuertite building on hope,<br />
Loue makes folks hardy, alas the flesh is fraile,<br />
Dispences now a little with the Pope:<br />
And fr&#333; restrictions giues her heart more scope.<br />
O Liberty, Author of heresie.<br />
Why with such violent wing dost thou assaile,<br />
To hurry vertue to impiety.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">62</span><br />
<br />
No pardon will she now implore of <i>Rome</i>,<br />
Her selfe she pardons twenty times an houre,<br />
Nor yet an heretike her selfe doth doome,<br />
Since she hath <i>Mahomet</i> within her power.<br />
O loue too sweet, in the digestion sower!<br />
Yet was he made, as nature had agreed,<br />
To match them both together from her wombe,<br />
And be a ioyfull grandam in their seed.<br />
<br />

<br />
A face Nature intended for a maister peece,<br />
And louely as the maide (though a blacke pearle)<br />
Painters and women say, an <i>Eben</i> fleece,<br />
Doth well beseeme the shoulders of an Earle:<br />
Blacke snares they were, that did entrap this girle<br />
Each haire like to a subtile serpent taught her,<br />
Of the forbidden fruit to taste a peece,<br />
Whil'st <i>Eue</i> is stain'd againe here in her daughter.<br />

<br />
His eyes were stuck like Comets in his head,<br />
As if they came to treate of nouelties,<br />
And bring the world and beautie into dread:<br />
That he must conquer chastest chastities.<br />
O who such tempting graces could despise,<br />
All voluntarie sinnes soules may refraine,<br />
But Natures selfe that of the flesh is bred,<br />
Such power she hath, that vice she will retaine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">65</span><br />
<br />
Let me, faire Greeke, a little plead for thee,<br />
Like a vaine Orator, more for applause,<br />
And swolne commends, of those are standers by,<br />
Then profits sake, or goodnesse of the cause.<br />
If men that vpon holy vowes do pawse,<br />
Haue broke, alas, what shall I say of these,<br />
The last thing thought on by the Deitie,<br />
Natures step-children, rather her disease.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">66</span><br />
<br />
Maide, why commit you wilfull periurie?<br />
To you I speake that vowe a single life,<br />
I must confesse y'are mistresse of beauty:<br />
Which beautie with your oaths is still at strife.<br />
Then know of me, thou, widow, maide or wife,<br />
She that is faire and vowes still chast to stand,<br />
Shall find an opposite to constancie,<br />
Fooles Oracles last not, are writ in sand.</div>

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">67</span><br />
<br />
Long did this beautious martyr keep her faith,<br />
Thinking that <i>Mahomet</i> was full of error:<br />
Treading that high c&oelig;lestiall milkie path,<br />
Virginity, that did produce hels terror,<br />
Yet knowing loue in Princes turnes to wrath,<br />
She meanes to catch his fancies with her cunning:<br />
But so resistlesse is this Princes feruor,<br />
Though he imprison loue, still feares his cunning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">68</span><br />
<br />
For like a Castle seated on a rocke,<br />
Besieg'd by thousands danger each way spread,<br />
That had withstood the battery of warres shock:<br />
The liuing making bulwarkes of the dead.<br />
So did this Virgins thoughts to her hart flock,<br />
Wiuing her danger, when her powers were lost:<br />
<i>Hyrena</i> will yeeld vp her maiden head,<br />
A gift to make <i>Ioue</i> proud, or silence bost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">69</span><br />
<br />
He gently woes her with the misers God,<br />
The <i>Indians</i> ignorance, and vertues slaue,<br />
Bright flaming gold, for where that ha's abode,<br />
All doores flies open to the wish we craue.<br />
Gold is mans mercy, and his makers rod,<br />
She loues the King for honor and for riches,<br />
He makes her eyes his heauen, her lap his graue,<br />
A womans face oft Maiesties bewitches.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">70</span><br />
<br />
When news is brought him that his foes are come,<br />
He catches straite this maiden in his armes,<br />
Calling for musicke that is now his drumme:<br />
Ile keepe thee safe (quoth he) for other harmes,<br />
Tho spoke in thunder they to me are dumbe.<br />
To counsell now they call him with low duty,<br />
But her Idea so his sences charmes,<br />
He drownes all speech in praising of her beauty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">71</span><br />
<br />
One tels him that the Christians are in field.<br />
You do not marke her beauty, he replies.<br />
Two mightie Cities to their power doth yeeld:<br />
Note but the lustre sparkling from her eyes.<br />
Your subiects hearts, against your life are steeld:<br />
Her tongue is musick, that strikes wonder dumbe.<br />
Your people struck with warre by millions dyes:<br />
If she but frowne then I shall ouercome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">72</span><br />
<br />
Shall I feare this worlds losse enioying heauen,<br />
Or thinke of danger when an Angel guards me?<br />
Can greater glory to my life be giuen,<br />
Then her maiesticke beauty that rewards me?<br />
Nay is not he of happinesse bereau'd,<br />
That neuer saw her face nor heard her voyce,<br />
And those that win our loue, most regards me,<br />
Confesse that we are godlike in our choice.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">73</span><br />
<br />
He left his Ianisaries in a trance,<br />
And to her priuate chamber straite enioyes,<br />
His bloud within his azure veines doth dance:<br />
"In loue th' effects are seene before the cause:<br />
For nectar'd kisses and a smile by chance,<br />
Are but loue branches, though they grow vp first,<br />
And <i>Cupid</i> thus confines vs in his lawes,<br />
To tast the fountaine ere we quench our thirst.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">74</span><br />
<br />
Night like a Princes pallace full of light,<br />
Illumin'd all the earth with golden starres,<br />
Here Art crost Nature, making day of night:<br />
And <i>Mahomet</i> prepares him for loues warres.<br />
A banquet is ordain'd to feed delight,<br />
Of his Imperiall bountie with expences:<br />
A heauen on earth he presently prepares,<br />
To rauish in one hower all her sences.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">75</span><br />
<br />
Her eyes could glance no way but saw a iewell,<br />
As rich as <i>Cleopatra</i> gaue her loue.<br />
Pictures haue power to warme ice with loues fewell.<br />
The gentle treading of the Turtle-doue,<br />
The Camels lust that in his heate is cruell:<br />
And <i>Iupiter</i> transformed from a man,<br />
When with his breast the siluer streame did moue,<br />
And rauish <i>L&aelig;da</i> like a snowy Swan.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">76</span><br />
<br />
The table furnisht, to delight the taste,<br />
With food aboue <i>Ambrosia</i> diuine,<br />
Such as would helpe consumptions that did wast:<br />
The life bloud, or the marrow, Greekish wine,<br />
So high one draught would make <i>Dian</i> vnchast.<br />
<i>Nectar</i> is water to this banquets drinke,<br />
Here <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> did his art resigne,<br />
And pleasure drown'd with standing on the brink.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">77</span><br />
<br />
To please her hearing Eunuches sang as shrill,<br />
As if that nature had dismembred them,<br />
All birds that ecchoes musicke through the bill,<br />
Sang ioy to her in an vndittied antheme:<br />
An artificiall heauen stands open still,<br />
Filling the roofe with a sweet vnknowne noyse,<br />
Downe fals a clowd like a rich diadem,<br />
And showes a hundred naked singing boyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">78</span><br />
<br />
The sence of smelling with all rare deuises,<br />
That rich <i>Arabia</i> or the world can yeeld,<br />
The dew of Roses and choise Indian spices,<br />
The purest of the garden and the field.<br />
The earth to part with these rare gifts now rises,<br />
And vowes no more her nature so profuse,<br />
Shall let her sweets be from her breast distild,<br />
To feed their vanitie with her abuse.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">79</span><br />
<br />
Then in a rich imbroidred bed of downe,<br />
Pluck't from the c&#333;stant Turtles fethered breast,<br />
Vpon her head he set imperiall crowne,<br />
And to her goes: Now is his soule at rest.<br />
This night he counts the end of his renowne,<br />
The sence of feeling, she feeles by his power,<br />
And like a subiect yeelds to his request,<br />
Whilest <i>Mahomet</i> a virgin doth deflower.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">80</span><br />
<br />
Now feares this flower deflowr'd his loue will waine,<br />
Wishing the lustfull act had bin vndoon,<br />
The pleasure cannot counteruaile the paine,<br />
For still she thinkes with torment ioy is woon,<br />
His loue growes full, she gets it now with gaine:<br />
He like a ring of gold insets his iewell,<br />
But fearing of his force she should disdaine,<br />
Till sighes and kisses did inflame Loues fewell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">81</span><br />
<br />
Then like the God of Warre, caught in a net,<br />
He twin'd his <i>Venus</i>, danger was not nigh,<br />
And as a Diamond compar'd with Iet,<br />
So show'd her sparkling eye against his eye.<br />
The sunne-gaz'd Eagle now this done doth get,<br />
And gently gripes her, hurting not his pray,<br />
She sounds with pleasure, second sweets are high<br />
And wishes <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> blinde all night, no day.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">82</span><br />
<br />
The red-cheek't morning opens now her gate,<br />
And busie day breathes life into the world,<br />
The heauens great coachman mounted is in state,<br />
And darknesse from the aire to hell is hurld.<br />
Now pleasures king by day light sees his mate,<br />
Whil'st she lay blushing like the damaske rose,<br />
His ietty haire she with her fingers curld,<br />
He hug'd her fast, least he his ioyes should lose.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">83</span><br />
<br />
Her sight begot in him a new desire,<br />
For that is restlesse alwaies in extreames,<br />
Nought but saciety can quench loues fire.<br />
Now throgh the christal casem&#275;t <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> beames<br />
Dazled those twinckling starres that did aspire,<br />
To gaze vpon his brightnesse being a louer.<br />
Tasting her petulans in waking dreames,<br />
To hide her from the sunne, he doth her couer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">84</span><br />
<br />
Then sweet breath'd musicke, like the chime of spheares,<br />
Did rauish pleasure, till this paire did rise:<br />
More wonder then that sound was to men eares<br />
Was her rare beauty to the gazers eyes.<br />
Ioy was so violent, the rockes it teares,<br />
The noise and triumphs beates vpon the aire,<br />
And like ambition pierceth through the skies,<br />
That <i>Ioue</i> loo'kt downe on her that was so rare.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">85</span><br />
<br />
Thus <i>Mahomet</i> both day and night doth spend,<br />
In obseruation of her eyes and pleasure,<br />
Growing so iealous, least he should offend,<br />
His soules perfection, natures vnspent treasure.<br />
If she but speake to him, he low doth bend,<br />
And such a seruitude he doth discouer.<br />
Neglecting of himselfe in that grosse measure,<br />
That <i>Hiren</i> clips her slaue, no Emperour.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">86</span><br />
<br />
Her chamber is her prison (O most willing)<br />
And there like house-doues they each other woo<br />
At first shee'l shun him, after fall a billing,<br />
And with imagination make him doo.<br />
Thy eies quoth <i>Mahomet</i>, saues thousands killing<br />
For all my force vpon thee shall be spent,<br />
Thy warres directions I do best allow,<br />
Thy Armes my Armour, and thy bed my Tent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">87</span><br />
<br />
Who doth offend this paramour, straight dyes,<br />
As certainly, as if pronounc'd by fate,<br />
Who doth with duty please her, needs must rise,<br />
Her face directeth both his loue and hate.<br />
The grosest flatterer is held most wise.<br />
Now reignes swolne gluttony, red lust, and pride:<br />
For when the heart's corrupted in a state,<br />
Needs must the other parts be putrifide.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">88</span><br />
<br />
The c&#333;mons like wolues, bark againft the moone<br />
And sweare they wil depose him from his throne:<br />
The Nobles whisper, and intend, that soone.<br />
Some one shal let their griefe to him be knowne.<br />
To scape that office now is each mans boone,<br />
Who speakes against her whets a fatall knife,<br />
For he replyes, I loose but what's mine owne,<br />
As sure as we haue life, you loose that life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">89</span><br />
<br />
They stand amaz'd, by hearing their own feares<br />
Each viewing other with a face extracted:<br />
Some praying, cursing, other shedding teares,<br />
To see a Louer by a Souldier acted.<br />
Patience doth foole vs that so long forbeares,<br />
To tell our Emperour hee's turn'd a monster,<br />
And to such ease and vices so contracted.<br />
The world, his birth, and titles doth mis-conster.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">90</span><br />
<br />
Then <i>Mustapha</i>, beloued of the Turke,<br />
Stood vp, and said, I hazard will my head,<br />
Know Countrymen, Ile vndertake this worke,<br />
And if I fall, lament me being dead.<br />
No flattery within this breast shall lurke:<br />
For that to Princes eares is now grown common<br />
Whilest <i>Mahomet</i> to haue his pleasure fed,<br />
Doth loose the worlds sway for a fickle woman.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">91</span><br />
<br />
Vnto her priuate chamber straight he goes,<br />
And findes his foueraigne sleeping on her lap,<br />
On suddaine wakes him: Sir, here are your foes,<br />
The sound amaz'd him like a thunder-clap:<br />
Although you sleep, awak't are all our woes.<br />
The franticke Emperour vpon him stares,<br />
Relate in briefe the worst of our mishap,<br />
Man cannot wrong vs, when a God not dares.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">92</span><br />
<br />
This danger <i>Mehomet</i>, attends thy reigne,<br />
The Gods are angry with thy lustfull ease,<br />
Thy priuate pleasure is the Empires paine,<br />
To please your selfe you all the world displease:<br />
The Sophy, German, and the King of Spaine,<br />
Begirt thy safety with the ribbes of death.<br />
Then worthy Prince, your wonted valour cease,<br />
And take my counsel, though it cost my breath.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">93</span><br />
<br />
You are but the shadow of an Emperour,<br />
Not really effecting what you are,<br />
A slothfull Epicure, a puling louer,<br />
That now en'e trembles at the name of warre,<br />
Obliuion all thy former acts do couer,<br />
Most willing to remoue you I will dye,<br />
The sunne of honour now is scarce a starre,<br />
Vertue at first was sire to Maiesty.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">94</span><br />
<br />
The Emperour vpon his subiect stares,<br />
As if a Gorgons head he there had seene,<br />
How comes it vassall, that thy proud t&#333;gue dares,<br />
Speake to remoue mee fr&#333; this heauenly queene?<br />
The gods wold liue on earth, to haue their shares<br />
In my <i>Hirena</i>: Sirra, you want nurture:<br />
Thy life I will not touch now in my spleene,<br />
But in cold bloud it shall depart with torture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">95</span><br />
<br />
I feare not death, repli'd bold <i>Mustapha</i>,<br />
At your command I'le clime a steepy rocke,<br />
Then headlong tumble downe into the sea,<br />
Or willingly submit me to the blocke,<br />
Disrobe my nature, and my body flea:<br />
Yet in that tyranny I'le speake my minde,<br />
And boldly like a Souldier stand deaths shocke,<br />
Concluding, lust can strike the Eagle blinde.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">96</span><br />
<br />
His haughty words amaz'd this king of loue,<br />
Thou wert not wont to speake thus without duty.<br />
Can her embraces so my soule remoue?<br />
And must he be a coward dotes on beauty?<br />
Such rarity of pleasure I do proue,<br />
In her enioying, that my soule is fed,<br />
With that variety, to speake her truly,<br />
Each night she giues me a new maiden-head.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">97</span><br />
<br />
Yet shall my subiects know my power in this,<br />
That I can rule mine own affection:<br />
I pardon freely what thou speak'st amisse,<br />
Knowing it sprung from loue, and thy subiection:<br />
Your eies shall see me rob the earth of blisse,<br />
A sight too sad, all heauen strike men with terror,<br />
And in that act cast such reflexion.<br />
That kings shall see th&#275;selues in me their mirror.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">98</span><br />
<br />
Go, tell my Bashaes, and the noble bloud,<br />
I do inuite them to a royall dinner,<br />
And there I'le shew them loue can be withstood:<br />
Yet he that wrongs my <i>Greeke</i> is such a sinner,<br />
He cannot cleanse himselfe, washt in <i>Ioues</i> flood.<br />
Fortune this fate vpon my loue hath hurld,<br />
The Monarkes of the earth in hope to win her,<br />
Against her beauty would stake all the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">99</span><br />
<br />
Leaue vs: and be thou comforted my faire,<br />
I will aduance thee bou'e the stile of woman:<br />
Let not my words bring thee vnto dispaire,<br />
Thou shalt imbrace the Gods, for her's no man<br />
Worthy to taste thy sweetes, they are so rare.<br />
Drawn by the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> thou through heauen shalt ride<br />
And <i>Saturn</i> wo&#363;ded by loues litle bowman<br />
Shall get his sonne to haue thee stellifide.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">100</span><br />
<br />
Go decke thy beauty with heauens ornament,<br />
Shine Cinthia like with iewels in the night,<br />
As she with starres stucke in heauens firmament;<br />
But thine, the greater will deface her light,<br />
Making her yeeld to thee her gouernment.<br />
On <i>Saturnes</i> top thy face shall gaine opinion,<br />
Beyond cold <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> shining out so bright,<br />
Thou shalt be courted by her loue <i>Endimion</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">101</span><br />
<br />
Let ioy possesse thy heart, and be thou proud,<br />
In sight of all the Turkish Emperours Peares,<br />
Let not thy sunne of beauty in a cloud,<br />
Be hid from those, whose eies with deawy teares,<br />
For want of thy pure heate in shades do shroud,<br />
Their drooping forheads, but thy beames exhales<br />
All misty vapours, and the welkin cleares,<br />
Like putrifying lightning, or <i>Ioues</i> balles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><ins class="correction" title="Original reads '100'.">102</ins></span><br />
<br />
Then hand in hand they passe out of the roome,<br />
Her beauty like a blazing starre admired,<br />
Well may I tearme it so, it shew'd the doome,<br />
Of her liues date that instant was expired.<br />
Now to the presence chamber they are come,<br />
Where all in reuerence kisse the humble earth,<br />
Here nature tooke her own, and death hath hir'd;<br />
To giue that backe againe, which she gaue birth.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">103</span><br />
<br />
Now stands in the midst, and thus begins,<br />
(Taking the faire <i>Hirena</i> by the hand:)<br />
Which of you here, that such a creature wins,<br />
Would part with her, for honor, loue, or land?<br />
The gods were enuious wh&#275; they made those sins<br />
Which are th crowns of this fraile worlds c&#333;tent,<br />
Nor can it with their humane reason stand,<br />
To thinke our ioyes begets our punishiment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">104</span><br />
<br />
View but her hand, her lip, her brow, her eyes,<br />
The smalnesse of her waste, and comely stature,<br />
And let your iudgement bou'e your hatred rise,<br />
Th&#275; you must needs c&#333;fesse, she excels in feature.<br />
That you are onely fooles, I truly wise,<br />
Doe not her presence admiration strike,<br />

For feare she wrongs herselfe, and make the like.<br />

<br />
What man that hauing toild in hidden Art,<br />
Spent all his youth, and substance to the bone,<br />
All bookes and knowledge in the deepest part,<br />
To finde that <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, that gold-getting stone,<br />
And hauing it, to comfort his weake heart,<br />
Shall he his seruants, wife, or friends to please,<br />
With his owne eies go see that iewell throwne,<br />
Into the bottomelesse and gaping seas.<br />
<br />

<br />
Or which of you can haue the fortitude,<br />
To lop a limbe off, or pull out an eye,<br />
Or being in a heauenly seruitude,<br />
To free your selues would with the damned lye?<br />
Of force with me you now must all conclude,<br />
That mortall men are subiect to loues rod,<br />
But heere you shall perceiue that onely I,<br />
Am natures conquerour, and a perfect God.<br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">107</span><br />
<br />
Then with a smiling looke, he came vnto her,<br />
And kist her, bad her pray, and then he smil'd,<br />
I must not in my constancy now erre,<br />
Since by mine owne tongue I a God am sti'ld.<br />
He drawes a fatall Turkish Simiter,<br />
With it he parts her body from her head.<br />
And though his tyranny did proue so vile,<br />
She seem'd to mocke him smiling being dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">108</span><br />
<br />
Vntill he tooke it in his bloudy power,<br />
And then a crimson floud gusht out a pace,<br />
The fauor chang'd fr&#333; smiling and look't sower.<br />
And senceles teares ran trickling downe her face,<br />
As who should say, I thought within this hower,<br />
For me thou wouldst haue oppos'd heauen with strife,<br />
That earthly being is like falling glasse,<br />
To thee I lost virginity and life.<br />

<br />
Long stood he mute, and gaz'd vpon her forme,<br />
Till <i>Mustapha</i> came in to play his part,<br />
His eies shot lightning like a horrid storme,<br />
Th&#275; with his fauchion runs him through the hart,<br />
O could this diuell my soule so tranforme,<br />
That I must eate that snake in him did lurke,<br />
But this is hels instruction, the blacke Art.<br />
To giue our sins the means by which they work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">110</span><br />
<br />
O my <i>Hirena</i>, <i>Mahomet</i> then cries,<br />
Looke through the orbes, &amp; see an Emperour sad<br />
Detaine her not you rulers in the skies,<br />
But send her once more, to make Monarkes glad.<br />
My soule to thine like <i>Tartars</i> shaft now flies,<br />
They held his arme, or else he had done the deed<br />
This mighty <i>Mahomet</i> with loue growne mad,<br />
Can nothing ease you, but your heart must bleed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">111</span><br />
<br />
Where is that God-head due vnto your birth,<br />
Descended from the <i>Prophet Mahomet</i>,<br />
Recall your spirits to their former mirth,<br />
And keep your colour constant like the Iet.<br />
Now shew your fortitude, be God on earth,<br />
Marshall your men, giue eare vnto your Drum,<br />
And let your valour with the sunne being set,<br />
With the resplendancy burne Christendome.<br />
<br />

<br />
Awake dull mate, and leaue this trance,<br />
Be perfect man, as thou hast here thy being,<br />
Not subiect vnto passion or chance;<br />
But like thy selfe, with Kingly thoughts agree,<br />
Our siluer moone to heauen we will aduance,<br />
And Christendome shall mourne for <i>Hirens</i> fall,<br />
That heathen Princes our braue acts seeing,<br />
Shall yeeld the world to vs, we king of all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">113</span><br />
<br />
And for my loues vnkindly Tragedy,<br />
A thousand Citties for her death shall mourne,<br />
And as a relicke to posterity,<br />
Our priests shall keep her ashes in their vrne,<br />
And fame to future times with memory,<br />
Shall sound <ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'ber'.">her</ins> glory, and my loues effects,<br />
For, till this vniuersall Masse doth burne,<br />
Her beauty rests the wonder of her sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">114</span><br />
<br />
Now order my affaires for bloudy warre,<br />
For heere I vow this loue shall be my last,<br />
No more shall downy pleasure, like a barre,<br />
Stop my designes that now at honour gast,<br />
Shoote prophet on my forhead a blessed starre,<br />
A Tygers fiercenesse, and my heart shall moue,<br />
Because with <i>Hiren</i> all affections past,<br />
I'le pitty none, for pitty begets loue.</div>

<big>I</big><span class="smcap">n</span> the large confines of renowned <i>France</i><br />
There liu'd a Lord, whom Fortune did aduance,<br />
VVho had a Daughter, <i>Laura</i> call'd the faire;<br />
So sweet, so proper, and so debonaire,<br />
That strangers tooke her for to be none other,<br />
Then <i>Venus</i> selfe, the God of <i>Loues</i> owne Mother.<br />
Not farre from thence was scituate a Towne,<br />
The Lord thereof a man of great renowne;<br />
VVhom likewise Fortune blessed with a Sonne,<br />
<i>Amos</i> by name, so modest, ciuill, yong,<br />
And yet in sight so wondrous and so bold,<br />
As that therein he passed vncontroul'd:<br />
So kinde to strangers, and so meeke to all;<br />
Of comely grace, and stature somewhat tall.<br />
As the wide world not two such Impes affords,<br />
As were the off-springs of these happy Lords.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>Hunting he lou'd, and therefore in a morne<br />
He shakes off sleepe (for ease he laughes to scorne)<br />
Before the sable Curtaines of the East<br />
Proclaim'd the Sunnes approach vnto the west;<br />
Or <i>Tytan</i>, Lordly Ruler of the morne,<br />
Had in his Chariot, left the night forlorne;<br />
Or sounded sleepe to them, with whom (men say)<br />
It's darksome night when we enioy the day:<br />
He brac'd his Hounds, and striding o'er his Steed,<br />
Hope with a conquest did the youngster feed:<br />
VVhich done, he hyes him to a mighty wood,<br />
That ioyn'd where <i>Laura's</i> Fathers Pallace stood.<br />
Thither being come, a Bore he rais'd, whose pace<br />
Did make our hunts-man loose his Hounds in chase:<br />
Ranging the woods, he light into a Groue,<br />
More pleasant farre then that where <i>Venus</i> stroue<br />
To win <i>Adonis</i> to her hearts desire,<br />
Moued by the burning zeale of sweet <i>Loues</i> fire.<br />
In this sweet Groue God <i>Pan</i> did keepe his Court,<br />
And summon'd all the petty Gods resort,<br />
As Satyres, Nymphes, and others, to the same,<br />
VVhere all sing prayses vnto <i>Laura's</i> name.<br />
Into this Groue (neare to her chamber side)<br />
(To take the Ayre) she comes forth; soone espide<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Of the yong Hunts-man, who made haste vnto her,<br />
And thus the Nouice there beginnes to wooe her:<br />
Parragon of beauty, diuine, though earthly creature,<br />
And yet Celestiall in thy heauenly feature.<br />
This sodaine courting, and vnwelcome sight,<br />
Made her adde wings to feare, and to that, flight:<br />
He following after, caught her by the traine,<br />
That in a rage the Maide turn'd backe againe,<br />
And did demaund why he without remorse,<br />
Durst cause her stay, against her will, by force.<br />
Mou'd by the rosiate colour of thy face,<br />
(VVherein consists (quoth he) all heauenly grace)<br />
I was too bold, I must confesse indeede,<br />
To touch the seluage of thy sacred weede:<br />
For which my selfe Ile punish as thou wilt,<br />
VVith any paine, for my deserued guilt.<br />
Doe but pronounce the sentence of my death,<br />
These hands shall be the butchers of my breath:<br />
But since the merit of my fault's no deeper,<br />
Oh let me be thy Prisoner, thou my Keeper;<br />
So shall thine eyes be witnesse of the woe,<br />
VVhich for my bold offence Ile vndergoe.<br />
Pronounce thy sentence then. VVherwith she spake,<br />
You are your Crafts-man Sir: and there she brake.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Yet turning backe, quoth she, &ocirc; would 'twere true,<br />
Your loue were firme to me, as mine to you!<br />
And here she ceased: for when he came neare her,<br />
She was afraid that he would ouer-heare her.<br />
And art thou so vnwilling then, quoth hee,<br />
To doome the sentence which I aske of thee?<br />
Perswade thy selfe it is thy purer minde<br />
That will not let thy heart proue so vnkinde:<br />
O would that minde were mine, to ioyne thy hart<br />
Eyther to end my life, or ease my smart.<br />
Loue is my sute. Nor hate is my reply,<br />
Quoth she. Quoth hee, I cannot court it I;<br />
They which but view the error in my lookes,<br />
May finde I neuer learn'd in <i>Cupids</i> bookes:<br />
But like a stone rough hewen from the rockes,<br />
And after polish'd by the Masons knockes,<br />
The former shewes but base then in compare,<br />
So to my loue my speech disgraces are:<br />
For were my speech true patterne of my minde,<br />
Not as it doth, should't come, but farre more kinde,<br />
Like as the Marchant hearing of a losse,<br />
Is vvondrous sory for so great a crosse;<br />
And after heareth by a true report,<br />
His goods are safely landed in the Fort,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Cannot expresse the joy he doth conceiue:<br />
For why? it doth his senses quite bereaue;<br />
And yet with signe of sorrow blames th'euent,<br />
Although it seeme most plaine and euident.<br />
Or like a Ship toss'd by tempestuous weather,<br />
Now here, then there; now back againe, then thither<br />
That whirle-windes meeting (roaring out aloud)<br />
Make watry mountaines shew the ship each cloud:<br />
Then with such fury they descend the deepe,<br />
From top of triple-Cedar-mountaines steepe,<br />
As of the Seas rich orientall shew,<br />
Against their wils they take a counterview.<br />
So fares his minde, which tossed to and fro,<br />
Sometimes doth ioy, and other times is woe:<br />
Sometimes from depth ascends into the ayre,<br />
And though he hope, he hides it with despayre.<br />
So long with feruent zeale he mou'd his sute,<br />
Onely for want of words his tongue was mute.<br />
"VVhere true affection rules in hottest fires,<br />
"Dumbe signes and tokens then shew mens desires:<br />
For what he thought he shew'd, he could not vtter,<br />
<i>W</i>hich made him oft when he shold speak to mutter.<br />
She that was wounded with the selfe-same dart,<br />
Reueal'd with tongue that which she wisht with hart<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
And fram'd her answere, so much't could not grieue him,<br />
For 'twas a salue to wound and to relieue him.<br />
Say I could loue, quoth she, my milder minde,<br />
(Vnlesse you further moue) cannot vnkinde,<br />
Frame you an answere: for wee are by nature<br />
So much addicted to mans heauenly feature,<br />
That though your faults are great by your abuse,<br />
To blinde the same it is our womans vse.<br />
Then as thou found'st me, leaue me, if thou wilt;<br />
That shall be all I render for thy guilt.<br />
Further I will not credit thy report:<br />
Farewell; be gone, for I am mist in Court.<br />
With that shee flyes, and in her flight she leaues<br />
A well wrought Scarfe, which straight the winde vp heaues;<br />
And proud of such a prise, they doe infer<br />
With their embassage vnto <i>Jupiter</i>,<br />
And there presented it: who, as 'twas right,<br />
Did make the windes returne't with swiftest flight,<br />
Vnto the place where <i>Amos</i> stood amazed<br />
At that which hapt, who like a mad-man gazed,<br />
Wondring what she by this illusion meant,<br />
When to allure him was her whole intent:<br />
But led in admiration most of all,<br />
At the rich Scarfe which from the Maide did fall.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
He viewes the worke, where finding of <i>Apollo</i><br />
Chasing a Nymph, who swifter then a Swallow<br />
Flyeth his armes, for feare did lend her wings<br />
To flye from him which after her soone flings.<br />
Himselfe a foole he cals, that wanting skill,<br />
Being allur'd, he had not knowne her will.<br />
Doubtfull, he feares offence committed to her,<br />
That he so rashly, gain'st her will, durst wooe her.<br />
To cleare himselfe of which offence he flyes,<br />
Resolu'd to winne the Maide, or lose the prize,<br />
With prosperous hast. Oh may thy hast well speed,<br />
Whose wondrous loue did vertuously proceed:<br />
Not from the flames of filthy lusts desire,<br />
As was that Rome-borne <i>Tarquins</i> lustfull fire:<br />
But as vnspotlesse from that filthy thought,<br />
From that most hell-deseruing thing of nought,<br />
As euer heart lodg'd in a loyall brest,<br />
Or tongue, vntaught to lye, euer exprest.<br />
But why doe I digresse the path I tread,<br />
Cloying your eares with that your eyes doe read?<br />
Pardon my boldnesse, and giue eare a while<br />
To that, of him, which my inferiour stile<br />
Shall now expresse: though't not with honor stands,<br />
He thinkes one paire of legs worth twice two hands.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
The arrow swift sent from the sturdy bow,<br />
May be accounted (to his flight) but slow:<br />
At last he gain'd the Court, to vvhich being come,<br />
It shew'd like to the Pallace of the Sunne<br />
Describ'd in <i>Ouid</i>: for in length and fairenesse,<br />
None might surpasse the workmanship and rarenes.<br />
Through which his way lies, &amp; he needs must passe,<br />
The pauement Marble vvas, the vvals of Glasse:<br />
VVhereunder vvas so liuely caru'd the Story<br />
Of great <i>Joues</i> loue, his vvondrous vvorks, &amp; glory,<br />
VVith many others loue: vvhich to rehearse<br />
VVould adde a mighty volume to my Verse,<br />
Besides mine owne weake vvit: for I doe know it,<br />
He vvas a better workeman, then I Poet.<br />
Yet could not this abate the Louers pace:<br />
For he still holds the louely Maide in chase.<br />
Passing the Court, he comes into a greene,<br />
VVhich vvas in middest of the Pallace seene:<br />
Thorough the midst there ranne a pleasant Spring,<br />
On each side with a vvall of Bricke hemm'd in,<br />
Onely in midst, a Stile; beyond, a Plancke,<br />
VVhich for a Bridge did serue to eyther bancke.<br />
Ouer this Stile as <i>Laura</i> lightly skips,<br />
In her rent garment happily it slips,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
And held her there a while till hee came to her,<br />
VVhere once againe the Nouice gins to vvoe her.<br />
Flye not thy friend, our Maker vvilleth so,<br />
Things reasonlesse approue and vvish it so,<br />
If vvithout sense and reason all things then<br />
Obserue a better course then humane men,<br />
How sauage were we then offending so,<br />
Committing that vvhich vve offence doe know?<br />
O were my tongue a second <i>Orpheus</i> Harpe,<br />
That to my loue I might allure thy <ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'hearr'.">heart!</ins><br />
Or vvere thy loue but equall vnto mine,<br />
Then vvould thou seeke his fauor vvho seeks thine!<br />
Me thinkes vnkindnesse cannot come from thence,<br />
VVhere beauty raignes vvith such magnificence,<br />
I meane from thee, vvhom nature hath endow'd<br />
VVith more then Art would vvillingly allow'd:<br />
And though by nature you are borne most faire,<br />
Yet Art would adde a beautie to your share:<br />
But it being spotlesse doth disdaine receipt<br />
Of all vnpolish'd painting counterfeit.<br />
Your beautie is a snare vnto our wayes,<br />
VVherein once caught, wee cannot brooke delayes;<br />
VVhich makes vs oft through griefe of minde grow sad,<br />
Griefe follows grief, then malecontent &amp; mad.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Thus by deniall doe you cause our woe,<br />
And then doe triumph in our ouer-throw.<br />
What is it to be fayre? onely a vanitie,<br />
A fading blossome of no perpetuitie.<br />
Consider this: for beautie is a flower,<br />
Subiect to ill occasions euery hower;<br />
It is a tenure holden as wee see<br />
<i>Durante Dei placito</i>, not in fee.<br />
Measure my Loue then, proue it by a tryall:<br />
Let me not languish still by your deniall.<br />
If in my suite I erre, as by mischance,<br />
Blame not my Loue but count it ignorance.<br />
The tongue is but an instrument of nought,<br />
And cannot speake the largenesse of the thought:<br />
For when the minde abounds, and almost breaketh,<br />
Then through abundance of the heart it speaketh:<br />
No man can speake but what he hath in minde,<br />
Then what I speake I thinke; be not vnkinde<br />
Vnto your seruant, who obedience proffers,<br />
And makes firme loue the obiect of his offers.<br />
I will not boast of Parentage, or Lyne,<br />
For all are base, respecting thee diuine:<br />
Nor will I boast of wealth, or riches store,<br />
For in thy face consists all wealth, and more.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Pure are my thoughts as skin betweene thy browes,<br />
And eke as chaste my speech, my oathes, &amp; vowes.<br />
Speake sweetest fayre, but one kinde word to me,<br />
How can alas that be offence in thee?<br />
There was a Dame a moderne Poet sung,<br />
<i>Hero</i> by name, like thee, both faire and young:<br />
And both so faire, that you did others passe<br />
As farre as rarest Dyamonds common glasse.<br />
VVhom young <i>Leander</i> courted on a greene,<br />
A Maide so faire (but thee) was neuer seene.<br />
She granted loue, which he (alas) to gaine,<br />
To reape those ioyes, did crosse the brinish Maine.<br />
My loue to thee, I now compare to his;<br />
Accounting danger, so requited, blisse.<br />
There are no Seas to separate our ioy,<br />
No future danger can our Loue annoy:<br />
Then grant to me what she denide not him;<br />
If good in her, in thee it is no sinne.<br />
The Sunne hath shin'd thus long, &ocirc; let not now<br />
The Sunne be darkened by thine angry brow.<br />
But rather let each looke a Comet be<br />
That may presage my happy destinie.<br />
I could to you a short discourse impart,<br />
That would relent the direst stony hart,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
VVer't not offence. It's no offence quoth she.<br />
Then thus the same Ile briefely tell, quoth he:<br />
A poore old man by chance did breake his leg,<br />
And he was told where he was wont to beg,<br />
That such a Surgion (telling of his name,)<br />
If that he pleas'd, could quickly cure the same.<br />
VVhich when he heard, to him for helpe he goes,<br />
And craues for Gods sake he would ease his woes.<br />
The Surgion greedy to haue coyne therefore,<br />
But finding none, he would not heale the sore:<br />
VVhich caus'd the poore old man to keepe his bed,<br />
That he for want of helpe in time was dead.<br />
Alas poore soule; (quoth shee) and did he dye?<br />
VVould I were Iudge, or hee were such as I,<br />
I so would vse the Surgion, as that hee<br />
Should feele the griefe which he before did see.<br />
Thus you confesse your wrong to me sweet Maid,<br />
If you performe (quoth he) the vvords you said.<br />
I am the man, who wounded, seeke reliefe:<br />
And you, the causer of my endlesse griefe;<br />
You are the Surgion, whom I vrge the more<br />
To cure the wound because you made the sore.<br />
Be not obdurate then, sith my disease<br />
Is quickly cured, if the Surgion please.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
And this I vow, water shall turne to fire,<br />
Huge massie mountaines to the clouds aspire;<br />
The Sun shall leaue his course, the Moon her brightnes,<br />
Night turne to day, and day shall lose his lightnes;<br />
Fishes shall flye, birds swimme; and Hare shall hunt<br />
The Hound, which to pursue the Hare vvas wont:<br />
Ayre, Earth, Fire, VVater, all things which you view<br />
Shall change their natures, ere I turne from you:<br />
And longer then I breathe a loyall friend,<br />
Let me (&ocirc; heauens) endure a wicked end.<br />
Silence (quoth she) and here let cease thy sute,<br />
Cause of distrust in loue did make me mute:<br />
Aske why I yeelded in so short a season,<br />
Because I loue, that is a womans reason.<br />
Yet Maides are fearefull; for by mens abuse,<br />
Courting is turned to a common vse,<br />
How is he held, that cannot in these dayes<br />
Fash'on his words to each fantasticke phrase?<br />
VVhich makes vs oft with one word to debase<br />
Him from our bosomes, whom our hearts imbrace:<br />
And, as you men doe for a Prouerbe make it,<br />
That which we loue we oft say nay and take it.<br />
Delayes breede danger, wherefore what I said,<br />
And what agrees with Honour, and a Maid,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
I yeeld to thee, but yet on this condition,<br />
Thou shalt not dare t'attempt the least fruition<br />
Of my chaste thoughts, by drawing them aside,<br />
Before in wedlocke I am made thy Bride.<br />
This said; shee to the Court, hee to his Hounds,<br />
<i>W</i>here they had slaine a Bore, whose bloud abounds:<br />
Glad of his prey, he hastneth home amaine,<br />
VVith short returne he comes to her againe,<br />
And hauing ioyn'd themselues in <i>Hymens</i> bands,<br />
The sacred Priest vniteth heart and hands:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They reape those ioyes which elder louers know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus my Tale doth end, thus ends their woe.</span><br />

<div class="poem">
<span class="dropcap"><img src="images/i233.jpg" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -1em;" alt="W" /></span>hilst that the Sunne was climing vp in haste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To view the world with his ambitious eye.</span><br />
Faire <i>Myrha</i>; yet alas, more faire then chaste.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did set her thoughts to descant wantonly;</span><br />
Nay most inhumane, more then bad, or ill,<br />
As in the sequell you may reade at will.<br />
<br />
You that haue parents, or that parents be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Depart a space, and giue not eare at all</span><br />
To the foule tale that here shall vttered be:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some filthy shame let on all other fall,</span><br />
If possibly there can be any such,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From nature to degenerate so much.</span><br />
<br />
O then with <i>Ouid</i>, I am wonderous glad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That this small world of ours is put so farre</span><br />
From those that such incestious people had:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So rest thou still in glory as a starre.</span><br />
That scorning thrusts from other nations quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in thy vertues doth thy selfe delight.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span><br />
And now faire <i>Myrha</i> in her youthly blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth on her father dote with fond desire.</span><br />
Each foule occasion is accounted good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That may increase her filthy lustfull fire.</span><br />
And as this shamefull matter wanted grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So doubtfully she thus doth plead her case.</span><br />
<br />
Why should not Gods this loue of mine permit?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or be offended with me for the same?</span><br />
It doth infringe their sacred lawes no whit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adding dishonour, or deseruing blame.</span><br />
I will proceed, good reasons for to proue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis not vnlawfull to obtaine my loue.</span><br />
<br />
In many countries I do certaine know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The parents with their children married be,</span><br />
Which they do most, their godlinesse to show,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because their loues increast thereby they see.</span><br />
Then shal this lucklesse plot of ground remaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Th'occasion that my loue I not obtaine?</span><br />
<br />
Each night hath Nature set at liberty:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All things be c&#333;mon, for she naught restrains:</span><br />
Then let the Daughter with the Father lye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like president with all things else remaines.</span><br />
The Kid, the Heifer, and the birds we see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Affect the same of whom they gotten be.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span><br />
In happy case then such her creatures are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That may do so, and yet do no offence,</span><br />
They be more happy then is mankinde farre:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they by some malicious base pretence</span><br />
Haue made a curbe to hold that still in thrall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which Nature would haue common vnto all.</span><br />
<br />
But yet packe hence thou foule incestious loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What, wilt vpon thy only father dote?</span><br />
I ought to loue him; yet as doth behoue,<br />
Not that the world therby my shame may note.<br />
O do resolue! the neerenesse of our kin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cuts off all hope thy wished suit to win.</span><br />
<br />
Did <i>Cupid</i> then ere shoot so yet before?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can <i>Vulcan</i> forge so foule an arrow now?</span><br />
Or further: will dame <i>Venus</i> euermore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such cruelty vnto her seruants show?</span><br />
No, no, I am deceiu'd; for now I see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With poisoned snakes some fury wo&#363;ded thee.</span><br />
<br />
How great (said she) &ocirc; <i>Venus</i> mayst thou be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How was I rauished this present night,</span><br />
In feeling of your pleasant sports in me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I clipt a man in prime of his delight,</span><br />
What liuely pleasures did I there conceiue?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No fault (alasse) but they too soone did leaue.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><br />
Would <i>Cynarus</i> thou hadst some other name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How fitly mightst thou haue a loue of me?</span><br />
How nobly mightst thereby increase thy fame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How quickly shouldst a son gaine vnto thee?</span><br />
I would inforce dull earthly thoughts, to craue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To kisse and clip, and other pastimes haue.</span><br />
<br />
What meane my dreams? haue they effect at all?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May dreames a future chance to vs portend?</span><br />
Let then to me such dreames more oft befall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In dreames no present witnesse can offend.</span><br />
In dreames we may as great a pleasure take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As in some sort is found we being awake.</span><br />
<br />
But yet avaunt, packe hence foule filthy fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wring out some teares to quench this cursed flame</span><br />
No otherwise the daughter-like require<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy fathers loue, that blazons on thy shame.</span><br />
Yet put the case he first did seeke to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No doubt I should to his request agree.</span><br />
<br />
Why should it not then stand right so with him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since of one nature we participate?</span><br />
What if with speech thou chance his loue to win<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then maist thou write, <i>No time is yet too late</i>.</span><br />
What thou dost blush to speake, loue bids thee write<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Belieue me they read more th&#275; we indite.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><br />
Resolu'd on this, with trembling hand she takes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pen and paper, framing for to write,</span><br />
Left h&#257;d holds way, whilst right the leter makes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Composing what she did in minde indite.</span><br />
She writes, she doubts, she chageth this for that,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She likes, dislikes, &amp; notes she knows not what.</span><br />
<br />
She casts away, and doth begin anew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet findes a want in that she framed last</span><br />
She blots, &amp; then againe that thing doth view,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the first more fits then all that's past.</span><br />
Father she writes, yet shame did blot it out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then thus she writes, and casts away all doubt.</span><br />
<br />
I know not what, sends to I know not whom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such health that thou maist only giue to me,</span><br />
Which if I want, my life cannot be long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Euen that same health thy louer sends to thee.</span><br />
I dare not tell thee who I am for shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor (out alasse) once let thee heare my name.</span><br />
<br />
And if thou aske of me what I desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or why so doubtfull I do write to thee,</span><br />
Would namelesse I might tell what I require,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till that my sweet were granted vnto me:</span><br />
Which if to know, thou wouldst make further triall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A maiden asketh but a maids deniall.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><br />
In token of my wounded heart, I would<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within these blotted lines there might apeare</span><br />
My colour pale, my body leane and cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My watery eyes, my sighes and heauy cheere,</span><br />
Then mightst perceiue I were in loue with thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how the flames of loue tormenteth me.</span><br />
<br />
I call the Gods as witnesse to the same<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poore wretched wench, I stroue to flie the dart</span><br />
And did my best that out-rage for to tame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which <i>Cupid</i> had alotted for my smart,</span><br />
No wench bare more then did to me betide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which forc'd me shew the cause that I would hide.</span><br />
<br />
Then mercy at thy gentle hands I craue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fearefull wise to thee I make my mone,</span><br />
Thou onely maist thy louer spill or saue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No enemy doth sue, but such a one</span><br />
That is aly'd most sweetly vnto thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet in a neerer band would linked be.</span><br />
<br />
My life is thine, and thou didst giue it me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then loue thy selfe and thou wilt me affect,</span><br />
My beauty's much, and is deriu'd from thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then all thy owne be carefull to respect.</span><br />
O stop thy eares, and heare not <i>Myrha's</i> name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shut thy eies wh&#275; thou dost read the same.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span><br />
My youthfull yeares rash folly doth beseeme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The skill of law to aged folkes belong,</span><br />
And all is lawfull that we list, I deeme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We take no notice of the right or wrong,</span><br />
If it offend to take thy owne in't bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let that offence be layd vpon my head.</span><br />
<br />
Then set apart the dread of worldly shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And take the Gods, as presidents herein,</span><br />
My pregnant wit shall shun all future blame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our pleasure scapes wel, hid with name of kin,</span><br />
And you may clip and kisse, and play with me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A daughters name me thinkes a cloke wil bee.</span><br />
<br />
Haue mercy now, I haue my case exprest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which loue inforst my fearefull hand to write:</span><br />
O grant thy daughter this her first request,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is the occasion of her chiefe delight,</span><br />
This Epitaph deserue thou not; I haue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cruel father tooke the life he gaue.</span><br />
<br />
And though my lines are blotted euery where,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas with my teares that fell ere it was dry,</span><br />
And if my letters scribled do appeare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereby you thinke some other wrot to try</span><br />
Your mind: because my curious hand is mist,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fearefull minde, doth bring a shaking fist.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><br />
And so these scrambled lines I do commend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vnto your loue, be-blurred all with teares,</span><br />
With feruent hope they shall no whit offend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The minde is base, that stil continuall feares.</span><br />
And note you which is the greater blot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To get no childe or kill that you haue got.</span><br />
<br />
Thus much this lustfull Lady writ in vaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seald it closely with a precious stone,</span><br />
A precious stone clos'd vp a filthy staine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her trusty seruant forth she cals anone,</span><br />
And blushing bad him with a merry cheare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He should this letter to her father beare.</span><br />
<br />
This scarcely said, old <i>Cynaras</i> did come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she cast her letter quite aside.</span><br />
Daughter (said he) you see the daily throng<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of suters that do seeke thee for their bride:</span><br />
Here be their names <i>my wench</i>, th&#275; come &amp; show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On which of them thou wilt thy selfe bestow.</span><br />
<br />
Now for a space she silent did remaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And onely gazed wishly in his face:</span><br />
She could her teares no longer then restraine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they ran trickling down her cheeks apace</span><br />
Her father kisses her, and bids her peace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought it tender-hearted shamefastnes.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><br />
He dry'd her cheekes, and said, my wench be stil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy yeares of right, a husband now doth claime</span><br />
Thou shalt not liue a maid by my good will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor longer shalt a wanton bed refraine,</span><br />
Then what, or who wilt haue? come tell me now.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At length she did reply; one like to you.</span><br />
<br />
He did allow the choyce, and praisd the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kist and clipt her for her louing speech,</span><br />
Not deeming that it tended to their shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It pleasd her well, &amp; wisht that he would seech</span><br />
A further suit; and then made this request,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let me live still with you, let wooers rest.</span><br />
<br />
Your company I most of all affect,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Continue but your loue, it shall suffice,</span><br />
These wrangling husbands why should I respect?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her father thus againe to her replies,</span><br />
Thy godlinesse (at which she blushed red)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I like, but thou must tast a Bride-groomes bed.</span><br />
<br />
Thou dost not know the pleasure it affords,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor wanton motions that therein abound.</span><br />
It not consisteth all of pleasant words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More gamesome tricks are there stil to be fo&#363;d</span><br />
A minde so chaste as thine cannot conceiue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What pleasing sports one shall therby receiue.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span><br />
It is no dreame, nor passion of the minde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a substantiall pleasure there doth dwell,</span><br />
The practike part of dreames therein we finde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which who so doth omit, leades Apes in hell.</span><br />
Why dost thou blush? I know your case, belieue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Maids must say nay, yet take when men do giue.</span><br />
<br />
And now the sable horses of the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Haue drawne a mantle ore the siluer sky,</span><br />
And all the stars doe shew their borrowed light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each breathing thing oprest with sleep doth ly</span><br />
Saue <i>Philomell</i>, that sings of <i>Terreus</i> rape,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>Myrha</i> plotting some incestious scape.</span><br />
<br />
No rest at all she tooke within her bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flames of <i>Cupid</i> burnt so in her brest,</span><br />
And many a fansie comes into her head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which ouer-much her troubled soule opprest,</span><br />
She <i>doubts</i>, she <i>hopes</i> th&#275; <i>feare</i> doth make repaire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sh'l now att&#275;pt, then <i>shame</i> doth bring despaire.</span><br />
<br />
Looke how you see a pleasant field of Corne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moue here &amp; there by gentle-breathing wind,</span><br />
Now vp and downe, as waues in sea are borne:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So doubtfull thoughts had motion in her mind:</span><br />
Now shee'l surcease, and now to him repaire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instable, like a feather in the aire.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span><br />
O fye vpon this fowle incestious lust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That very Nature greatly doth abhorre,</span><br />
Some plague will fall vpon all such I trust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If in this world there can be any more.</span><br />
I hope this little world well free-ed is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Giants, and such monstrous beasts as this.</span><br />
<br />
So God preserue it, if it be his will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let the Gospell euer flourish here,</span><br />
Yet I do feare we haue some yet as ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pleasing fooles do with their folly beare:</span><br />
In Paradice I see wee cannot live,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But we shall finde some foule seducing <i>Eue</i>.</span><br />
<br />
My tongue doth stagger to repeate her name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So foule a blot a Christian cannot brooke,</span><br />
Go seeke a glasse to see this filthy shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon <i>Gods holy Bible</i> daily looke:</span><br />
And there thou maist, as in a mirror see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No <i>Alkeron</i> can yeeld the like to thee.</span><br />
<br />
There sucke the <i>Nectar</i> of his <i>Holy Word</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And begge thou pardon for thy foule abuse,</span><br />
For euery <i>Sore</i> it can a <i>Salue</i> afford.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O <i>Atheist</i>! learne to make of it good use.</span><br />
Thou Christians blot, to leaue off further talke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whilst thou hast light, endeuor there to walke.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><br />
And thou <i>P&aelig;nchaia</i>, rich in manys a thing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In <i>Custus</i>, <i>Cynamon</i> and <i>Incense</i> sweete,</span><br />
That out of trees aboundantly doth spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of <i>Ammonie</i>, and things for vses meete.</span><br />
Yet whilst thou yeeldest <i>Myrrh</i>, I wey thee not:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thereunto hath <i>Myrha</i> giuen a blot.</span><br />
<br />
No measure in her filthy loue she found:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ease, no rest, but death doth like her now.</span><br />
Resolu'd on this she gets vp from the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mindes to hang her selfe, her loue to shew,</span><br />
And then the noose about her necke she drawes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said, &ocirc; <i>Cynaras!</i> thou art the onely cause.</span><br />
<br />
Farewell therfor, a thousand times farewell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deere <i>Cynaras</i> thou mightst haue sau'd my life,</span><br />
And thinke then, this to me alone befell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because I durst not loue thee as a wife.</span><br />
Farewell againe. Oh welcome gentle death!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she went about to stop her breath.</span><br />
<br />
A recompence fit for so foule a mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yet by chance her aged Nurse did lye</span><br />
Within a chamber that to hers adioyn'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who ouer-hearing this, to her did hye;</span><br />
And seeing her halfe murdered, so began<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shrieke &amp; screeme, &amp; straight vnto her ran.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span><br />
Who first did snatch her girdle from her necke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And powring teares vpon her plentuously,</span><br />
Did hold her in her aged armes, though weake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kissing her did vrge the reason why</span><br />
She went about away herselfe to make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or to her shame so base a course to take?</span><br />
<br />
Quoth she, I pray thee tell the cause to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold these empty dugs, and head all gray,</span><br />
These hands that pain haue took in rocking thee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let some, or all these, cause thee to bewray</span><br />
What cruel means haue broght thee in this case.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At which the Lady turnd away her face.</span><br />
<br />
O be not coy sweet! hide thou nought from me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am thy Nurse, she said, and haue good skill</span><br />
In charms, &amp; hearbs, &amp; dreams, that powerful be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what thou wantst, Ile helpe thee to thy fill.</span><br />
Art thou in loue, or witcht by any wight?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Il'e finde thee ease, or else will free the quite.</span><br />
<br />
I haue bene wanton once as well as you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now yet by age, am altogether dull,</span><br />
I haue beene loue-sicke, as you may be now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of toyes and loue-trickes I was wondrous full,</span><br />
How strange so ere thy case do therefore stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I can and will redresse it out of hand.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span><br />
Thou art in <i>Loue</i> (my sweet) I well espy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If so, no lacke shalt finde in me, I sweare,</span><br />
The Lady in her armes sob'd bitterly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Nurse replyd, and sayd; Why do not feare,</span><br />
Thy father shall not know of this at all:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At which she starts, and on her bed doth fall.</span><br />
<br />
And frantickly she tumbles on her face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said, get hence (good Nurse) I pre'thee go,</span><br />
Constraine me not to shew my wicked case.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That case (quoth she) I pray thee let me know.</span><br />
Get hence, she answer'd, or enquire lesse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis wickednesse thou wouldst haue me c&#333;fesse.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis such a thing, that if I want, I die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And being got, is nothing else but shame.</span><br />
The Nurse hereat did sigh most heauily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on her knees besought to know the same,</span><br />
And holding vp her hands as she did kneele,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said; Madame, tell the priuie griefe you feele.</span><br />
<br />
If you will not discouer this to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will acquaint your father out of hand,</span><br />
How you had hang'd your selfe, wer't not for me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But if you tell, your trusty friend Il'e stand,</span><br />
And let your griefe of any nature be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shall go hard, but Il'e finde remedy.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><br />
And if your case be ill, you need not feare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heauie load the wickednesse doth bring,</span><br />
I'le teach thee how most easily to beare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My age hath got experience in each thing.</span><br />
Tell me what 'tis that doth so neerely touch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One woman may perswade another much.</span><br />
<br />
And now the Lady raisd her heauy head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hanging vpon her Nurses bosome fast,</span><br />
As she did rise vp from her slothfull bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being prodigall, her christall teares to waste,</span><br />
Now she wold speak, &amp; now her speech doth stay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Th&#275; shame doth cause her turne her face away.</span><br />
<br />
A franticke fury doth possesse her now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she drawes her garment ore her face,</span><br />
And wrings her hands, &amp; to her Nurse doth vow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to acquaint her with her wretched case.</span><br />
And shedding brinish teares into her breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus much her griefe to her at last exprest.</span><br />
<br />
Oh happy is my mothers happy state!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hath a husband <i>Debonaire</i> and faire,</span><br />
Vnhappy am I, most infortunate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At which he stopt, as one falne in dispaire.</span><br />
The Nurse soone found <i>Senecdoche</i> in this,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what the whole meant by a perfect gesse.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><br />
Her aged bones did shake and tremble fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her hoary haire stood staring vp on end,</span><br />
From forth her eyes a heauy looke she cast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a sigh her heart distrest did send;</span><br />
And pausing long, not knowing what to say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last her tongue her minde did thus bewray.</span><br />
<br />
In this I hope, good Lady, you but iest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To try your Nurses now-decaying wit;</span><br />
So foule a fault is not within your breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then tell me true the occasion of this fit.</span><br />
The Lady frown'd, &amp; stopt her speaking farther,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said get h&#275;ce, is't shame to loue our father?</span><br />
<br />
I she reply'd, in such a filthy sort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is not loue, but lust that you professe,</span><br />
Necessity with true loue cannot sort;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your loue contaminates, you must confesse.</span><br />
A daughters loue then to your father show,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some loue <i>good things</i> but with <i>bad loue</i>, I know.</span><br />
<br />
Or if your wanton flesh you cannot tame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor coole the burning of your hot desire,</span><br />
Then take some one that not augmets the shame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set apart to dote vpon your fire.</span><br />
It is most vile to stand in such a need,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make the actor baser then the deed.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span><br />
Besides, his yeares can yeeld no such content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blithsome wanton dames expect to haue,</span><br />
Herein your bargaine you will soone repent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wh&#275; you shal find great want of that you craue:</span><br />
Are you so mad, o will you once beleeue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old men content to frolicke Dames can giue?</span><br />
<br />
Take this example of me, from the Sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold a shooting star from heauen fall</span><br />
Whose glimmering light you scarcely do espye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it is gone as nothing were at all;</span><br />
And so their sports being scarse begun doth leaue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As in the aire concressions we perceiue.</span><br />
<br />
Or as the bloomes vpon the Almond-tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That vanish sooner the the mush-rums done:</span><br />
Or as the flies <i>H&aelig;mere</i> we do see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leaue their breath their life being scarce begunne,</span><br />
Who thinks that tree whose roots decai'd by time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can yeeld like fruit to yong ones in their prime.</span><br />
<br />
A rotten sticke more fit to burne then vse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I maruell what from age you do expect,</span><br />
Let my experience their defect accuse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And teach thee how thy equals to affect;</span><br />
When they should toy, iocund &amp; sport with thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their gouts, coughs &amp; cramps, wil hindrance be.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><br />
'Tis nor their fault, but incident to age,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which far more imperfections with it brings,</span><br />
As iealousie, suspicion, fury, rage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dislike, disdaine, and other such like things,</span><br />
For can the fire, hot in nature, dwell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With water cold, but they at length rebell.</span><br />
<br />
Euen as in Summer one may aptly note,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fire and water in one cloud contain'd;</span><br />
And neither, yet, the mastery hauing got,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being opposits, their furie's not restrain'd,</span><br />
But do contend in strife and deadly warre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Til scolding Thunder do pronounce the iarre.</span><br />
<br />
Choose from thy woers some peculiar one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose loue may fill the measure of thy hopes,</span><br />
And balonize thy wanton sports alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose appetite with thy desire copes,</span><br />
Youth will be frolicke in a Maidens bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Age is vnapt and heauy as the lead.</span><br />
<br />
Youth hath his daliance and his kind embrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Euen as the Elmes incircled with the Vine;</span><br />
Age loueth rest and quiet in this case,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saying, Oakes at such like Iuy gripes repine,</span><br />
Yuths pleasing weltun'd years sweet musick maks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When for c&#333;sort loue strings it strains or slakes.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><br />
Yet chuse thou one whose tongue's not set on wheeles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who eats his words before he brings th&#275; forth</span><br />
That no <i>decorum</i> in his talking feeles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such are but buzards, blabs of little worth:</span><br />
And for complexion, heerein mee beleeue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The perfect sanguine sweet content doth giue.</span><br />
<br />
The Phlegmaticke is like the water cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Cholericke wants sap, like fire dry,</span><br />
And Melancholy, as age, is dull and old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in the Sanguin moist warme iuice doth lie,</span><br />
Whose beauty feeds the eye with sweete delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rest do rather feare then please the sight.</span><br />
<br />
What pleasure can a sterne grim face affoord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A swarfie colour or rough shagged haire,</span><br />
Or Rauen blacke? beleeue me at a word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are too blame that do despise the faire:</span><br />
They please the eye, prouoke dull appetite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resemble Gods, and do the minde delight.</span><br />
<br />
Cease chatting gentle nurse, the Lady said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or frame thy Tale to sute more with the time,</span><br />
My choice is made, therein I neede no aide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which may be compast by some help of thine,</span><br />
It is too late of abstinence too preach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wh&#275; one is drunk, &amp; notes not what you teach.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><br />
I seeke him not for lust, as you do deeme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For if my mind were onely bent thereto,</span><br />
I could find other men I might esteeme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You know the store of Suters come to woe:</span><br />
But 'tis some kind of naturall instinct,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or deuine flame that cannot be extinct.</span><br />
<br />
What I do seeke I know is wondrous vile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And haue a will for to withstand the same,</span><br />
Yet can those motions by no meanes exile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So seeketh lust to bring me vnto shame,</span><br />
Be it worse th&#275; nought to haue it flesh doth striue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Helpe Nurse, else long I cannot liue.</span><br />
<br />
And wish not to disswade me in this case,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor giue me counsell to withdraw my minde</span><br />
It likes me well, I weigh not the disgrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O teach me then to win him to be kind!</span><br />
Helpe me good Nurse in this my cruell state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All other meanes of comfort comes too late.</span><br />
<br />
And since thou needs woldst vnderstand my sham<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I did grieue and blush to ope to thee,</span><br />
And had lear di'd then told thee of the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now be not slacke to lend thy helpe to me,</span><br />
Thou forst me for to open my disgrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then lend thy help to salue my wretched case.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><br />
You do not know good Nurse or haue forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What 'tis to loue, and cannot it obtaine,</span><br />
Of youths kind daliance age doth take no note,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetting it, and thinke all may abstaine:</span><br />
But tis not so, I to those thoughts reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then helpe me gentle Nurse, or else I die.</span><br />
<br />
Liue still my sweete, quoth she, and do possesse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet name of (father) shame forc't her conceale</span><br />
And with a staggring speech the word represt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all her helpe more amply to reueale,</span><br />
She made a vow, whereby herselfe she bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To do the best that might in her be found.</span><br />
<br />
The feasts of gentle <i>Ceres</i> now began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which yearely they obseru'd, and held it ill,</span><br />
For thrice three nights to lye with any man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wiues in white, apparrelled were still,</span><br />
And vnto <i>Ceres</i>, first fruit of the field,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As garlands made of eares of corne) did yeeld.</span><br />
<br />
The Queen amongst these women did frequent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These Rites, and would be absent at that time.</span><br />
The Nurse then to accomplish her intent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And finding <i>Cynaras</i> made blith with wine,</span><br />
The Syren most inchantingly did sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus at last broke silence to the King.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span><br />
Renowned King, but that your constant loue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Restraines my tongue &amp; holds my speeches in,</span><br />
A wanton question I would to thee moue?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speak on, quoth he, good Nurse thy speech begin,</span><br />
With <i>Bacchus</i> feasts do wanton sports agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know thou wouldst no ill thing vnto me.</span><br />
<br />
Then thus, quoth shee, there is a gallant Maide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Princely birth and Noble high degree,</span><br />
Who at this time would be right well apaide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To kisse thy hand, shee is so in loue with thee,</span><br />
Such diuine beauty in her face doth lurke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Gods enuy at Nature for the worke.</span><br />
<br />
Without offence vnto your Queene and Wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vnto this Lady, she is a homely cate,</span><br />
I loue your Queene, and honour her as life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And but admire the others happy state,</span><br />
That's made so faire that none can like her bee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your Queene is kind, abuse her not for mee.</span><br />
<br />
But if you saw her face, as I haue done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And view'd the rest of her proportion'd limbs,</span><br />
You would contemne my Mistres face too soone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet loue th&#275; both: it nought your honor dims,</span><br />
One as your wife, the next for beauties sake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So of them both a beauteous wife but make.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span><br />
The glory of her haire is wonderous bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vpon her brows doth ebbe and flow content</span><br />
Her eies in motion do beget delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her cheekes a tincture to <i>Aurora</i> lent</span><br />
Her teeths no pearle, her eyes no rubies are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But flesh and bone, more red and white by far.</span><br />
<br />
No lisping tongue that fondrels count a grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But doth to well tun'd harmony incline,</span><br />
A necke inferior nought vnto the face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And breath most apt for to be prest by thine,</span><br />
Now if the vtter view so glorious proue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Iudge how the hidden parts procure loue.</span><br />
<br />
The King who all this while lent listening eare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being wrapt in admiration of her speech,</span><br />
Now did begin more liuely to appeare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for to know one thing of her did seech,</span><br />
Saying, of what yeeres may this Lady be?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Iust of sweete <i>Myrahs</i> age, replied shee.</span><br />
<br />
He said then, bring her to conferre with mee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I may try if all be true you say.</span><br />
It is most true, as after you shall see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But said the Nurse, you now must let her stay,</span><br />
Perhaps shee'le blush, and be to coy by light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she will yeeld more kindly in the night.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><br />
Such pretty Dames will hardly yeeld consent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For in their mouthes they alwaies carry nay,</span><br />
Yet if you giue, to take, they are content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nere refuse, whatere their tongue doth say:</span><br />
For so they nature simple men abuse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When what they loue they most of all refuse.</span><br />
<br />
If I do fable, put me vnto shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In saying she resembles <i>Myrha</i> much,</span><br />
For 'tis so much, as if it were the same;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when you seeke to gaine the loue of such</span><br />
Let my experience thus much you assure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They Fawlcon-like stoop to a ganey lure.</span><br />
<br />
And now you may, voide of suspected crime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dally with her in your lasciuious bed,</span><br />
The sacred <i>Ceres</i> feasts are at this time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there your Queen is stil: this scarcely sed,</span><br />
Quoth <i>Cyneras</i>, bring her this night to mee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereto the Nurse replide, I do agree.</span><br />
<br />
With hopefull newes the Nurse return'd againe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cheer'd her chicke, &amp; bad her not be sad,</span><br />
Her wished sute, she certaine should obtaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The news wherof made <i>Myrha</i> wondrous glad.</span><br />
Yet as she ioy'd, she was opprest with feare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such discords of affections in her were.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span><br />
Away slips time and hasteneth on the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the Beare's seene run about the Pole</span><br />
Conducted forward by Bo&aelig;tes bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other stars about the axe-tree role:</span><br />
The Southerne images do shine as gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fit monuments for Hunters to behold.</span><br />
<br />
At what time <i>Myrha</i> wickedly proceedes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And takes in hand to act her base desire,</span><br />
The shamefull lust with cursed hopes she feeds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which quickly sets her heart vpon a fire,</span><br />
And thereupon resolueth on her shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not one thought to contradict it came.</span><br />
<br />
At which the Sunne his glorious face did hide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each Planet pulleth in his golden head,</span><br />
The other stars out of the heauens glide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>Cynthia</i> from her siluer Palace fled,</span><br />
The night is robbed of her wonted light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each thing turn'd dark that formerly was bright.</span><br />
<br />
Three times, by stumbling, <i>Myrha</i> was fore-told<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of bad successe, if she did not retire;</span><br />
Three times the Owles like lessons did vnfold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose dolefull note do foule mishap require;</span><br />
Yet she crept on, regarding not the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The want of light alayed much the shame.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span><br />
The Nurse doth lead her by her owne left hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The right doth grope the dark and desart way,</span><br />
As silent as the night they now do stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To heare the night-crows scrik, &amp; goblins play</span><br />
The lich-foule beats, and at the window cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to come in, to stay the enterprise.</span><br />
<br />
O gentle Nurse, said <i>Myrha</i> tell to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What may these scremes &amp; doleful scriks portend,</span><br />
The nurse reply'd, my child, no hurt to thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are but servants that on night attend,</span><br />
These goblins, lich-fouls, Owls, &amp; night-crows to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At murthers raile, with loue haue naught to do.</span><br />
<br />
And then the Beldam leads the Lady on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through many roomes &amp; other turning waies</span><br />
As in a laborinth they two had gone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as they go, she to the Lady saies;</span><br />
Now cheere you vp, and get a iocund minde<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thinking of the pleasures you shall finde.</span><br />
<br />
At last shee brings her to the chamber dore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which softly she did ope, and led her in,</span><br />
The Lady fals to trembling more and more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her very heart did to relent begin,</span><br />
The neerer to the wickednesse she went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The more to quake and shiuer shee was bent.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span><br />
Looke how you see a blind man on the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Led by another through some desart place,</span><br />
Stagger and grope and at each trifle stay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For feare least he should fall: euen in like case,</span><br />
The wretched nurse the fearefull Lady leads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who shakes and starts at euery step she treads.</span><br />
<br />
And now she doth her enterprise repent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wish she might vnknowne returne againe,</span><br />
Vnto his bed the pawsing Nurse then went;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cal'd the King &amp; told him thus much plaine</span><br />
Dread King awake, of pleasures take thy fill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This Ladie's thine, then vse her as you will.</span><br />
<br />
The cursed father then his bowels takes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into his bed, &ocirc; filthy blob and staine,</span><br />
His daughter shiuers in his armes, and quakes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This being done, the nurse returnes againe</span><br />
And said, make much of her, to weepe forbeare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None wold weepe for that which you now feare.</span><br />
<br />
The King then cheeres his daughter, in his arme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why dost thou weep? be still my sweete, be stil,</span><br />
Come clip thy loue I meane to do no harme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Kingly bed with pleasures shall thee fill,</span><br />
And to hide all that idle heads may moue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hence-forth I call thee daughter and not loue.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span><br />
Come kisse thy father, gentle daughter then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A</i>nd learne to sport thee in a wanton bed;</span><br />
Is this the tricks (she softly said) of men?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And counterfeiting speech vnknowne, she said,</span><br />
A daughters name, me thinkes, doth not agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ist well with your owne child in loue to be?</span><br />
<br />
The King, not deeming who lay by his side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Replies, what hurt deere Lady can it be?</span><br />
No ill I know by that meanes can betide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loue more firme thereby we common see:</span><br />
It is not ill though men the same not craue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For we want daughters till a wife we haue.</span><br />
<br />
She did reply, and said, why put the case<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I were <i>Myrha</i> for as men do say,</span><br />
My countenance resembleth much her face;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were't not offence, think you, with me to play?</span><br />
Misdeeming nought, againe, he doth reply;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more th&#275; 'tis with thee, sweet wench, to lie.</span><br />
<br />
O would, quoth <i>Myrha</i>, you could likewise proue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereby I might but know some reafon why,</span><br />
It were not ill to grant to you my loue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That loue should then alone to you apply;</span><br />
Were I your daughter I might well consent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say halfe so much for me I am content.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span><br />
The King replies, my sweete, my will is law,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And may command my subiects when I will,</span><br />
Besides all this, you furthermore do know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You must obey, I call you daughter still;</span><br />
Then talke no more, she said, I do agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy daughter and thy subiect yeelds to thee.</span><br />
<br />
Oh! now the father his owne child doth take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of his owne he doth his owne beget,</span><br />
Of his owne loines another child doth make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Repugnant to the Law that nature set;</span><br />
May ones owne seed to procreation moue?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No sure, unlesse it doth a monster proue.</span><br />
<br />
Their musicke is the scriking of the Ow'es,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if the fiends came for to sunder them,</span><br />
The rauing dogs affright them with their howles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As all the fiends came forth to iniure them;</span><br />
The stars behind the clouds, a great way hence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like spies lie peeping to disclose the offence.</span><br />
<br />
Their bed doth shake and quauer as they lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if it groan'd to beare the weight of sinne,</span><br />
The fatall night-crowes at their windowes flie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cries out at the shame they do liue in:</span><br />
And that they may perceiue they heauens frown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Poukes &amp; Goblins pul the couerings down.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span><br />
The pillow that her cursed head doth beare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is a castle of accursed ill,</span><br />
The weighty burthen of the same doth feare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therefore shrinketh inwards from her stil:</span><br />
Whilst both the ends high swelling with disdaine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like angry foe-men raise themselues amaine.</span><br />
<br />
The bed, more kind then they religious are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth seeke to shroud their foule defiled act,</span><br />
And therefore lets them fall into it farre<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As in some vale for to conceale the fact:</span><br />
Like bulwarkes rising to defend their names,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or swelling mountains to obscure their shames.</span><br />
<br />
O there they lie and glut themselues with sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A iocund sin that doth the flesh delight,</span><br />
A filthy flesh that can reioyce herein,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A silly ioy that gainst the soule doth fight,</span><br />
A fasting sport, a pleasure soone forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bringeth shame with an eternall blot.</span><br />
<br />
Thrice happy now, had wicked <i>Myrha</i> bene,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If some foule swelling <i>Eban</i> cloud would fall,</span><br />
For her to hide her selfe eternall in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or had the bed bene burnt with wilde fire all,</span><br />
And thereby moult the heauens golden frame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That al things might haue ended with her shame.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span><br />
And now reuenge, a souldier vnto lust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes scouring in, as it had bene beguil'd</span><br />
Accompanied with fame and foule distrust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with disgrace, blacke luxures basest child,</span><br />
These threaten them and blaze abroad the fact,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like to Trumpets thunder out the act.</span><br />
<br />
Not many nights they spending in this sort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But <i>Cyneras</i> at length desir'd to know</span><br />
Who 'twas affoorded him this pleasant sport,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And freely did the curtesy bestow:</span><br />
And hauing done this taske vs'd euery night.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth he doth steale and goes to seek the light.</span><br />
<br />
O hide thee <i>Myrha</i>, 'tis not time to sleepe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thunderbolt is leuel'd at thy head,</span><br />
Vnlesse thy eies prepare them for to weepe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fire and sword thou art betrai'd in bed,</span><br />
Awaken wench, the day of doome bewray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see the father his owne child betray.</span><br />
<br />
And whither steales thou furious <i>Cynaras</i>?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why seekes a light to open thy owne shame?</span><br />
Who hop'st to finde in this accursed place?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make not such hast to spy thy ignoble game,</span><br />
Stay, stay thy feete, thou wilt repent to late,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mischiefe itselfe comes in with speedy gate.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span><br />
What, sleepst thou <i>Myrha</i>? why th&#275; sleep thou long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or else awake and welcome in thy woes,</span><br />
Another happy day will neuer come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale misery thy pleasure ouer-goes;</span><br />
Dreame sleeping, thou didst with thy father lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or wake, and see him reuenge the villany.</span><br />
<br />
Confound thy head, and all thy parts with feare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thinke the fiends incompasse thee about,</span><br />
Striuing with burning tongs thy flesh to teare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pulling thy tongue and eies with tortures out;</span><br />
O thinke with raizors they do flea thy skin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A</i>dding new tortures vnto euery sin.</span><br />
<br />
Now comes the father, being fully bent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to disclose his loue with his faire light,</span><br />
Sleepe <i>Myrha</i>, thou hast time for to repent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arise in care, passe many a weary night;</span><br />
Looke <i>Cyneras</i>, and spy disgrace too soone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Myrha</i> awake, see what thy lust hath done.</span><br />
<br />
Blush lustfull King, and see the end of lust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold thy owne dishonour and disgrace,</span><br />
Learne what it is to vse thy wife vniust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lay a Strumpet in her Princely place,</span><br />
Sham follows th&#275; reu&#275;ge hangs o're their heads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That basely do defile their marriage bed.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span><br />
It's like a tender flower nipt with frost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It euer after hangs his drooping head,</span><br />
And hath her wonted prime of glory lost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or like the cup that hath his <i>Nectar</i> shed:</span><br />
Cracke you the richest pointed Diamond,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all his prise and glory's lost and gone.</span><br />
<br />
Old <i>Cynaras</i> his daughter knowing well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For very anger could not speake a word,</span><br />
But into most outragious fury fell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And would have kil'd the Lady with a sword,</span><br />
But nimbly she, by helpe of cloudy night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conueyes her selfe out of her fathers sight.</span><br />
<br />
Most like a Lyon, ranging for a pray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each corner of the house he madly lookes,</span><br />
No barre, or stop, doth hinder him, or stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He rifles chambers, beds, and secret nookes.</span><br />
This Lyon seekes for her, the dart did throw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quietly lets all the other go.</span><br />
<br />
By this the Lady's in the <i>Arabian</i> fields,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fearefully doth range about the same,</span><br />
Which plenteously the bearing <i>Date-tree</i> yeelds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At length she also through <i>P&aelig;nchaia</i> came,</span><br />
Her fathers rage being something over-past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At <i>Saba</i> land she doth arriue at last.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span><br />
The King not finding her, begins to fret,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vex himselfe with anguish, care &amp; griefe,</span><br />
He scoulds with fortune, that this trap did set,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A</i>nd chides the Fates for yeelding no reliefe:</span><br />
Small sorrowes grew till they to greater came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like little sparkes increasing into flame.</span><br />
<br />
Euen as a river swelling ore her bounds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By daily falling of small drops of raine,</span><br />
Likewise his care continually abounds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By howerly thinking of his his fault againe,</span><br />
Content were found soone in calamity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thought thereof raz'd out of memory.</span><br />
<br />
Daughter, quoth he, with eyes full fraught with teares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What hast thou done? &ocirc; foule accursed child!</span><br />
Why hast deceiu'd my aged blosom'd haires?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why didst thy Princely Father so beguile?</span><br />
<i>A</i>lasse! I erre, thou art no childe to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor longer Il'e thy louing father be.</span><br />
<br />
Go seeke some hole eternall to lye in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A</i>nd neuermore behold the heauens light,</span><br />
Thou hast disgraced all thy name and kin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hide thee euerlasting from my sight,</span><br />
Thou hast not onely brought vs both to shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But made thy father actor of the same.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span><br />
How will thy mother thinke her selfe abus'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hast made her a quot-queane shamefully,</span><br />
Of filthy incest I do thee accuse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Lemmon-like didst with thy father lye,</span><br />
Then hye to hell, haste to the Furies there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When raging parets witnesse gainst thee beare.</span><br />
<br />
Oh but the fault thy owne was most of all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poore <i>Myrha</i> thou didst meane no hurt to me,</span><br />
It wot: thou said'st (my selfe I witnesse call)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twas ill with your owne childe in loue to be.</span><br />
And vrg'd againe, what if she <i>Myrha</i> were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I basely said, there was no fault in her.</span><br />
<br />
Then rent thy braines with terror of the deed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Confused thoughts burst thine accursed breast,</span><br />
As if thou did'st on deadly poyson feed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in <i>Elisium</i> let thy soule nere rest,</span><br />
Rore seas, quake earth, till you deuoure him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hath defil'd his daughter with foule sin.</span><br />
<br />
Yet she did know I was her father deere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What meant she then to seeke me in such sort?</span><br />
I did not know my daughter to be there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therefore wished her no kind of hurt.</span><br />
She sin'd, and knew her father she abused,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sin'd, uncertaine who it was I vsed.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span><br />
By this the Sunne neere past the Zodiaque ore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thrice three signes had fully ouer-run,</span><br />
Returning tow'rd the point he was before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ninty degrees wanting thereto to come,</span><br />
He had the Cliptike and one quadre gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in that space the child ripes in the womb.</span><br />
<br />
When <i>Myrha</i> weeping much her barne to beare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tired with wandring in the wood so long,</span><br />
Weary of life beginneth for to feare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What shall hereafter on herselfe become.</span><br />
Now she perceiues the folly lust did bring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And may take time of penitence to sing.</span><br />
<br />
Things done in haste, haue leasure to repent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A hasty braine is neuer wanting woe,</span><br />
Youth with <i>Decorum</i> seldome is content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yong yeares and lust associat-like do goe,</span><br />
Youth hath no wit till it be deerely bought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And often times then it is good for nought.</span><br />
<br />
Alasse! quoth <i>Myrha</i>, bursting out with cryes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What shall I do that haue so vilely erred?</span><br />
Let bellowing grones pierce vp into the skyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all the Gods to pitty may be stirred,</span><br />
O let some Trumpets voice from thee be driuen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To waken mighty <i>Iupiter</i> in heauen.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span><br />
You gentle Gods, that wonted were to heare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The suppliant praiers of distressed soules,</span><br />
Now open wide your gracious listning eare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I may win some pitty with my houles.</span><br />
O let it stand with your omnipotence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to remit the sorrowfuls offence.</span><br />
<br />
I do confesse my wickednesse is much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there's no hope that I should fauour win.</span><br />
Yet your still-pardoning clemency is such,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That vndeserued you forgiue our sin,</span><br />
We run in errors every day most ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet you are apt to grant vs pardon still.</span><br />
<br />
What haue I gain'd? my fathers foule disgrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My owne dishonor, and my friends disdaine;</span><br />
What have I won? an imputation base,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My mothers curse, and a perpetuall staine,</span><br />
I seldome see one mischiefe to arise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it brings others at her heeles likewise.</span><br />
<br />
And since my fault into such height is driuen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I deserue not in the earth to rest,</span><br />
Nor haue a place amongst the starres in heauen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You nightly powers grant me this request:</span><br />
That neither with the dead nor liue I do remain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A</i>nd so no place in earth or heauen gaine.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><br />
To this her last request the Gods consent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so the ground her feet did couer ore,</span><br />
Out from her toes the scrawling roots were sent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which by her travell she had bruised sore.</span><br />
These twining roots most plentuously abound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they had fixt her body to the ground.</span><br />
<br />
Where be the walks that thou wast wont to haue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shady groues paued with Camomile?</span><br />
The rosie bowers that heate of Sunne did saue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yeelded to thy sence a pleasant smile?</span><br />
Where be the pleasant roomes thou solast's in.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou art dispoil'd thereof by thine owne sin.</span><br />
<br />
Thou shalt no more within thy Chariot ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gazing vpon the people kneeling downe.</span><br />
No more will come to woe thee for a Bride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lust hath defil'd the tipe of thy renowne,</span><br />
Those feet of thine, that to offence did lead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Imprisoned are, and not allow'd to tread.</span><br />
<br />
By this the growing tree so far had past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That her faire bones to timber turned were:</span><br />
Her marow did conuert to pyth at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all her bloud the name of <i>Sap</i> doth beare,</span><br />
Her armes to bowes, her fingers branches be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her skin to bark, and so she made a tree.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span><br />
Where is the face that did all faces staine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But shrunke within a hard consolid barke?</span><br />
No one will sue to kisse it once againe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But must be hid perpetually in darke.</span><br />
That snow-white-neck, that men desir'd to tuch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now they refuse to handle it as much.</span><br />
<br />
Where are those eyes, those glassy eyes of thine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lent the glorious Sun his chiefest light?</span><br />
Where is that Angels voyce, that voyce deuine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose wel-tun'd t&#333;gue did al the gods delight?</span><br />
What, are they gone? doth time thy glory rust?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No, they be spoiled with incestious lust.</span><br />
<br />
Farewell thy armes, made kindly to embrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now a bough for birds to pearch upon,</span><br />
Farewell thy pretty fingers in like case,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The curious Lute ordain'd to quauer on.</span><br />
Your wonted glory you shall see no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your filthy lust hath thrust you out of dore.</span><br />
<br />
Now with her shape she lost her sences quite.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that and for her fault she weepeth still;</span><br />
Which teares are held in honor, price, &amp; might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And daily do out of the tree distill,</span><br />
And from the gummy barke doth issue <i>Myrrh</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which evermore shall beare the name of her.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span><br />
At last the swelling wombe diuides the tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The infant seeking for some passage out,</span><br />
No Nurse nor Mid-wife could the baby see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vse of speech his mother is without,</span><br />
And could not therefore begge <i>Lucina's</i> aid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She might done well could she one prayer said.</span><br />
<br />
And therefore sighes and grones most heauily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bending most humbly to the ground below.</span><br />
Shedding from euery bow teares plenteously.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At length the Gods some fauour did bestow.</span><br />
And so <i>Lucina</i> laid her hand thereon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And speaking words, receiu'd the words anon.</span><br />
<br />
The watry <i>Nymphs</i> this pretty child take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on soft smelling flowers laid him downe,</span><br />
Of which a curious cradle they did make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hearbs perfumed were for more renowne.</span><br />
The Nymphs this boy affected more and more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with his mothers teares stil washt him ore.</span><br />
<br />
As yeares increase, so beauty doth likewise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And is more faire tomorrow then to day,</span><br />
His beauty more &amp; more continuall doth arise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That enuy did delight, in him bewray,</span><br />
As <i>Venus</i> fell in loue with him at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who did reuenge his mothers lusting past.</span><br />
